    "review": "' 'He does make me happy,' Clary said. 'But he can't control everything in the world, Mom. Other things happen&#151;' she fumbled for words; how could she explain that it wasn't Jace making her unhappy, but what was happening to him, without revealing what that was?' 'In a world where everything went away from him eventually, she was one of the few remaining constants.' Except for teasers, the fourth installment of Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments romance fantasy has been strictly embargoed, leaving us clutching for word clues. A teen series that keeps readers on tenterhooks.",
