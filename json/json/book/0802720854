But will he put his pride aside when he realizes that being with Kiara might finally allow him to be his true self?",

    "review": "Seventeen-year-old Carlos has moved around a lot in his life. He grew up in Chicago, but when his brother got involved with gangs, his mother moved the family, sans father, to Mexico. Now Carlos finds himself on his way to Colorado to live with his brother (now reformed and in college) and attend his last year of high school. He is resentful, handsome and cocky, and he has no plans to abide by anyone's rules. One of the first people he meets is Kiara, an honor student who has been assigned to escort him around school for the first few days. Carlos is dealing with his past, his current reputation, getting reacquainted with his brother, and the complex social situation at school. Kiara is dealing with her stuttering problem and her own place in the social system at school. She was recently dumped by a boyfriend via text message. Feeling like he doesn't need a babysitter, Carlos blows her off; with her retaliation, sparks fly as two opposite poles of a magnet begin to attract each other. The story is told in their alternating voices, and the final outcome is as predictable as a Harlequin romance novel (especially since this book belongs to 'A Perfect Chemistry' series). Nevertheless, it is an entertaining read while still being deep enough and well characterized enough to make the two protagonists interesting as they dance towards, away and then back to each through its pages.
