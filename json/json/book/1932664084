    "description": "Scott Pilgrim's life is totally sweet. He's 23 years old, he's in a rock band, he's 'between jobs,' and he's dating a cute high school girl. Nothing could possibly go wrong, unless a seriously mind-blowing, dangerously fashionable, rollerblading delivery girl named Ramona Flowers starts cruising through his dreams and sailing by him at parties. Will Scott's awesome life get turned upside-down? Will he have to face Ramona's seven evil ex-boyfriends in battle? The short answer is yes. The long answer is Scott Pilgrim, Volume 1&#58; Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life.",

    "review": "Scott Pilgrim is 23 years old, lives in a cold, unnamed Canadian  town, plays bass in a band called Sex Bob-Omb and has a very  cute 17-year-old Chinese-Canadian girlfriend, Knives Chau. His  'precious little life' is amiably unstructured, and he drifts,  happily unemployed, between band practice and time spent with  Knives. His relationship with Knives is chaste-walks, chats and  hugs-although Knives is getting bigger ideas. 'We haven't even  held hands,' Scott explains. 'It's just nice, you know.' But  then he starts having dreams about Ramona Flowers, a mysterious,  equally cute and perfectly legal hipster chick on Rollerblades  who delivers books for Amazon.com. Ramona is anything but  simple, and O'Malley's tale of adorable slackers in love is  transformed into a wildly magically manga-kung fu fantasy  adventure. We meet the first of Ramona's seven evil  ex-boyfriends, Matthew Patel, who challenges Scott and his band  to a supernatural martial arts duel right out of Crouching  Tiger, Hidden Dragon. O'Malley has crafted a delightfully hybrid  comics love story. It's an alt-lit, rock 'n' roll graphic novel  with wonderful manga-influenced drawing and a comically mystical  plot that manages to capture both the genuine intimacies and  serial dishonesties of young love.
