    "review": "Little Nutbrown Hare is trying to tell Big Nutbrown Hare just how much he loves him, but each time Big Nutbrown Hare's love seems to be bigger. Indeed, there is no way to measure the love, and Little Nutbrown Hare can finally only express it by saying his love is as far as the moon. After Big Nutbrown Hare kisses Little Nutbrown Hare goodnight, he whispers that his love is as far as the moon and back. This loving goodnight book has expressive and lively illustrations.",
