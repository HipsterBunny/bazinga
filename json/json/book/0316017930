    "review": "What makes the best, the brightest, the most famous, and the most successful excel? The answer to the question, Malcolm Gladwell insists, resides in the culture, family, and upbringing of these high achievers. To demonstrate his point, he delves into the backgrounds of soccer players, mathematicians, software billionaires, and even John, Paul, George, and Ringo. A super stimulating read; a buoyant Barnes & Noble Bestseller, now in paperback and NOOKbook editions. (Sidebar seminar&#58; In statistics, an outlier is an observation numerical distant and unrepresentative of the remaining data.)",
