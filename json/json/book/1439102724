    "description": "Every life has a soundtrack.All you have to do is listen.Music has set the tone for most of Zoe Baxter&rsquo;s life. There&rsquo;s the melody that reminds her of the summer she spent rubbing baby oil on her stomach in pursuit of the perfect tan. A dance beat that makes her think of using a fake ID to slip into a nightclub. A dirge that marked the years she spent trying to get pregnant.For better or for worse, music is the language of memory. It is also the language of love.In the aftermath of a series of personal tragedies, Zoe throws herself into her career as a music therapist. When an unexpected friendship slowly blossoms into love, she makes plans for a new life, but to her shock and inevitable rage, some people&#8212;even those she loves and trusts most&#8212;don&rsquo;t want that to happen.Sing You Homeis about identity, love, marriage, and parenthood. It&rsquo;s about people wanting to do the right thing for the greater good, even as they work to fulfill their own personal desires and dreams. And it&rsquo;s about what happens when the outside world brutally calls into question the very thing closest to our hearts&#58;family.INCLUDES A COMPACT DISC OF ORIGINAL SONGSMusic by Ellen WilberLyrics by Jodi PicoultAll songs performed by Ellen Wilber",

    "review": "One miscarriage too many spelled the end of Max and Zoe Baxter's marriage. Though the former couple went quite separate ways, their fates remained entangled&#58; After veering into alcoholism, Max is saved in multiple senses by his fundamentalist conversion; Zoe, for her part, finds healing relief in music therapy and the friendship, then romantic love with Vanessa, her counselor. After Zoe and Vanessa, now married, decide to have a baby, they realize that they must join battle with Max, who objects on both religious and financial grounds. Like her House Rules and several other previous Jodi Picoult novels, Sing You Home grapples with hot button issues. The novel also includes a CD of songs, each matched with a chapter in the book. Perfect for book clubs.",
