    "review": "&#8230;immensely readable and moving &#8230;While the pretext ofLittle Beeinitially seems contrived &#151;two strangers, a British woman and a Nigerian girl, meet on a lonely African beach and become inextricably bound through the horror imprinted on their encounter&#151;its impact is hardly shallow. Rather than focusing on postcolonial guilt or African angst, Cleave uses his emotionally charged narrative to challenge his readers' conceptions of civility, of ethical choice.",
