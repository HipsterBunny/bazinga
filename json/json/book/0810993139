The hazards of growing up before you&#8217;re ready are uniquely revealed through words and drawings as Greg records them in his diary.In book one of this debut series, Greg is happy to have Rowley, his sidekick, along for the ride. But when Rowley&#8217;s star starts to rise, Greg tries to use his best friend&#8217;s newfound popularity to his own advantage, kicking off a chain of events that will test their friendship in hilarious fashion.Author/illustrator Jeff Kinney recalls the growing pains of school life and introduces a new kind of hero who epitomizes the challenges of being a kid. As Greg says in his diary, &#147;Just don&#8217;t expect me to be all &#145;Dear Diary&#8217; this and &#145;Dear Diary&#8217; that.&#8221; Luckily for us, what Greg Heffley says he won&#8217;t do and what he actually does are two very different things.Since its launch in May 2004 on Funbrain.com, the Web version ofDiary of a Wimpy Kidhas been viewed by 20 million unique online readers.

    "review": "For any child thoughtful about growing up and who may be looking for a champion, Jeff Kinney has delivered it. In this hilarious diary told through the eyes of a 'wimpy kid,' the author tells the story of middle-schooler Greg Heffley, whose friend Rowley begins to move up in the social sphere. Greg decides to take advantage of the situation, and while his and Rowley's friendship is put to the test as a result, readers are laughing all the way. The first book in a series based on the author's online comic, this is a knee-slapping read that keeps fans anxious for more.",
