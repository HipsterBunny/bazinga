Lewis for the 21st century' (Newsweek).ANew York Timesbestseller people can believe in-by a 'pioneer of the new urban Christians' (Christian Todaymagazine).Timothy Keller, the founding pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City, addresses the frequent doubts that skeptics and non-believers bring to religion. Using literature, philosophy, anthropology, pop culture, and intellectual reasoning, Keller explains how the belief in a Christian God is, in fact, a sound and rational one. To true believers he offers a solid platform on which to stand against the backlash toward religion spawned by the Age of Skepticism. And to skeptics, atheists, and agnostics he provides a challenging argument for pursuing the reason for God.",

    "review": "This book owes at least a small debt to the author's congregation. In New York City's Redeemer Presbyterian Church, Timothy Keller ministers to a flock of 15,000. Over the years, Rev. Keller has compiled a list of doubts by parishioners and visitors. InThe Reason for God,he responds to seven common objections to religion in general and/or Christianity in particular. For believers or would-be believers, this book provides a reassuring response to books such asGod Is Not Great, Letter to a Christian Nation,andThe God Delusion.",
