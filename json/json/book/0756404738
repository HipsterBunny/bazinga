    "description": "'There are three things all wise men fear&#58; the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.' My name is Kvothe. I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life.

    "review": "For nearly four years, science fiction enthusiasts have been eagerly awaiting this second volume to Patrick Rothfuss' Kingkiller Chronicles. The first volume, The Name of the Wind, won the prestigious Quill Award and Terry Brooks praised it as 'deep and intricate and wondrous.' In this lynchpin book of the trilogy, Kyothe continues his perilous search for answers about the death of his parents even as he grapples with more pressing dangers. Bound to be a bestseller.  (P.S. The Name of the Wind is available in both mass market paperback and NOOKbook.)",
