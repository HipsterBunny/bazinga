    "description": "A Dazzling Russian travelogue from the bestselling author of Great PlainsIn Travels in Siberia, Ian Frazier trains his eye for unforgettable detail on Siberia, that vast expanse of Asiatic Russia. He explores many aspects of this storied, often grim region, which takes up one-seventh of the land on earth. He writes about the geography, the resources, the native peoples, the history, the forty-below midwinter afternoons, the bugs. The book brims with Mongols, half-crazed Orthodox archpriests, fur seekers, ambassadors of the czar bound for Peking, tea caravans, German scientists, American prospectors, intrepid English nurses, and prisoners and exiles of every kind&#8212;from Natalie Lopukhin, banished by the czarina for copying her dresses; to the noble Decembrist revolutionaries of the 1820s; to the young men and women of the People&#8217;s Will movement whose fondest hope was to blow up the czar; to those who met still-ungraspable suffering and death in the Siberian camps during Soviet times.More than just a historical travelogue, Travels in Siberia is also an account of Russia since the end of the Soviet Union and a personal reflection on the all-around amazingness of Russia, a country that still somehow manages to be funny.

    "review": "Three-fourths of Russia is in Siberia, but most of us think of its vast expanses only as a vague, frigid wasteland. New Yorker journalist and author Ian Frazier (Great Plains; On the Rez; Gone to New York) fills that vacancy with an energetic account of his ultimate road trip into the great unknown. The journey takes this intrepid American into the far reaches of this forbidding hinterland, but also deep into the often bizarre history of the region. Travels in Siberia spotlights Frazier's ability to be remarkably insightful without losing his sharp sense of wit. A dream pass for armchair travelers.",
