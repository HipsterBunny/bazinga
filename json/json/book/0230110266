    "description": "A social media expert with global experience with many of the world&#8217;s biggest brands &#8212;including Nike, Toyota and Motorola&#8212;Simon Mainwaring offers a visionary new practice in which brands leverage social media to earn consumer goodwill, loyalty and profit, while creating a third pillar of sustainable social change through conscious contributions from customer purchases. These innovative private sector partnerships answer perhaps the most pressing issue facing business and thought leaders today&#58; how to practice capitalism in a way that satisfies the need for both profit and a healthy, sustainable planet. Mainwaring provides case studies from companies such as P&G;, Walmart, Starbucks, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Toyota, Nike, Whole Foods, Patagonia, and Nestl&#233; as well as a bold plan for how corporations need to rethink their strategies.",

    "review": "Can big business be socially responsible? Brand consulting expert Mainwaring certainly thinks so. He believes new technologies aren't merely making life easier, they're making us better&#58; in allowing us to connect with each other across geographic, cultural, and language barriers, the Internet and social media might very well be increasing our capacity for empathy. His 'We First' ethos proposes cooperation between governments, philanthropies, and capitalist corporations to achieve meaningful social transformation. Social media&mdash;viral, borderless&mdash;is the perfect vehicle to promote 'contributory consumerism,' and Mainwaring has fascinating suggestions for technological innovation and systemic change&#58; he proposes a 'Global Brand Initiative'&#58; an association of corporate brands and their advertising partners and competitors that willingly work together (Coke with Pepsi, Greenpeace with WWF, the U.S. with China) to advance corporate social responsibility and charitable donations. Tall orders, all&mdash;but the author's enthusiasm and evidence make an excellent (and counterintuitive) case for big business's ability to make major strides in creating a more equitable world.
