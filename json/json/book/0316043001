    "review": "Bill Rasmussen would not have launched ESPN if a Connecticut hockey team hadn't fired him and his son. In fact, when it was first aired in 1979, ESP (it picked up the 'N' only later) was a distinctly local affair. Only later did it become a multi-billion dollar corporation and 'the Worldwide Leader in Sports.' James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales' Those Guys Have All The Fun accomplishes what many thought impossible&#58; It provides the inside history of a small enterprise that became a media behemoth that changed the face of broadcasting and sports. To research this book, Miller and Shales (Live From New York) conducted more than 500 interviews with outspoken luminaries including Chris Berman, Robin Roberts, Keith Olbermann, Hannah Storm, Mike Ditka, Bob Knight, and scores of others.",
