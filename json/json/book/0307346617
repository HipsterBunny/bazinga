    "description": "&#8220;The end was near.&#8221; &#8212;Voices from the Zombie WarThe Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of...",

    "review": "In the wake of the great zombie war, Brooks's fictional alter  ego travels around the world to ask tough questions of  individuals and leaders about their experience and actions  before, during and after the undead menace decimated the human  population. Brooks remarkably identifies and articulates the  nuances and unconsidered realities of what a zombie war would  look like. This intriguing 'oral history' stands apart from his  previous zombie-related book, The Zombie Survival Guide, as  Brooks uses the postwar culture here to provide political and  social commentary on a wide range of real-life individuals and  institutions. An all-star cast including Alan Alda, Mark Hamill,  J rgen Prochnow, Henry Rollins, John Turturro, Rob and Carl  Reiner, and many others deliver their parts with such fervor and  intensity that listeners cannot help but empathize with these  characters. Max Brooks acts as the interviewer, providing an  inquisitive but stagnant demeanor. The abridgment keeps the  story tight but struggles with the interviewer's narration  during interviews. When Brooks interrupts characters to indicate  that the person rolled his eyes or appeared apprehensive, his  comments are often moot because the performers are already  portraying such body language with their tone.
