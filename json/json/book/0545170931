    "review": "Christopher&rsquo;s debut is an emotionally raw thriller that follows the abduction of 16-year-old Gemma by Ty, a gorgeous, 20-something Australian who is in love with her and hopes to win her love in return. The fast-paced novel is written in the past tense as a sort of diary from Gemma to Ty, suggesting that she has escaped, though this makes the story no less suspenseful. Ty drugs Gemma in a Bangkok airport and transports her to the home he has built in the isolated Australian outback, believing he&rsquo;s rescuing her from shallow parents and a city life in London she never really fit into. Clever and determined, Gemma gathers her strength and plots numerous escapes to no avail. In the process, she encounters the wildness of her desert surroundings and carefully digs for Ty&rsquo;s weaknesses, patching together his complex history, including the extent of his six-year obsession with her. Gemma&rsquo;s fluctuating emotions are entirely believable&mdash;she&rsquo;s repulsed by Ty, but can&rsquo;t help recognizing the ways in which he&rsquo;s opened her eyes. It&rsquo;s a haunting account of captivity and the power of relationships. Ages 14-up. (May)",
