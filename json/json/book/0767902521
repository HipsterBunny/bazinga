    "description": "The Appalachian Trail trail stretches from Georgia to Maine and covers some of the most breathtaking terrain in America&#8211;majestic mountains, silent forests, sparking lakes. If you&#8217;re going to take a hike, it&#8217;s probably the place to go. And Bill Bryson is surely the most entertaing guide you&#8217;ll find. He introduces us to the history and ecology of the trail and to some of the other hardy (or just foolhardy) folks he meets along the way&#8211;and a couple of bears. Already a classic,A Walk in the Woodswill make you long for the great outdoors (or at least a comfortable chair to sit and read in).",

    "review": "Bill Bryson, whose previous traveloguesThe Lost Continent,Neither Here Nor There,andNotes from a Small Islandhave garnered the author quite a following, now returns to his native United States after more than two decades of living abroad. In order to rediscover America by, as he puts it, 'going out into an America that most people scarcely know is there,' he set out to walk, in the company of Stephen Katz, his college roommate and sometime nemesis, the length of the Appalachian Trail. His account of that adventure is at once hilarious, inspiring, and even educational.",
