    "review": "On Desperate Housewives, Eva Longoria's seductive character Gabrielle Solis spends much of her time in bedrooms, but in real life, the Emmy-nominated actress is just as devoted to the kitchen. Her first cookbook intersperses generous helpings of fascinating personal stories with one hundred of her favorite recipes; an appealing mix of Texas style Mexican, Italian, French, and adventurously eclectic. Like her interviews, Eva's cookbook is entertaining, soulful, and ultimately informative. Definitely a cut above your average celebrity cookbook.",
