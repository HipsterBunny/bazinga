    "review": "Catherine Coulter's new FBI thriller intertwines two exciting plot threads. In one, agents Dillon Savich and Lacey Sherlock search for a methodical female serial killer who may, or may not have a connection with slay-master Ted Bundy. In the other, Special Agent Lucy Carlisle learns from her dying father that her family has a skeleton in the closet; or, more specifically, in a steamer trunk. Headed for bestseller lists coast-to-coast.",
