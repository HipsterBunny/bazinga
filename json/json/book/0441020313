    "review": "There are some problems Sookie Stackhouse can't ignore; for example, the firebombing that she witnessed at Merlotte's, the bar where she works. Of course, true to form, our favorite telepath also has other dangerous things on her mind; for example, her Significant Other Eric Northman and his 'child' Pam seem intent on killing their vampire master. As usual, things quickly become absorbingly complicated. Sometimes it just doesn't pay to have special gifts. Bound to be a Barnes & Noble Bestseller. (P.S. Charlaine Harris' Stackhouse novels are the basis of HBO's hit drama True Blood, which begins its fourth season in June.)",
