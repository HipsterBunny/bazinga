    "description": "An instantNew York Timesbestseller and the follow-up to the mega-hitKitchen ConfidentialIn the ten years since Anthony Bourdain's classicKitchen Confidentialfirst alerted us to the idiosyncrasies and lurking perils of eating out, much has changed for the subculture of chefs and cooks, for the restaurant business&#150;and for Anthony Bourdain.Medium Rawtracks Bourdain's unexpected voyage from journeyman cook to globe-traveling professional eater and drinker, and even to fatherhood, in a series of takes-no-prisoners confessions, rants, investigations, and interrogations of some of the most controversial figures in food.Beginning with a secret, highly illegal after-hours gathering of powerful chefs that he compares to a mafia summit, Bourdain pulls back the curtain&#150;but never pulls his punches&#150;on the modern gastronomical revolution. Cutting right to the bone, Bourdain sets his sights on some of the biggest names in the foodie world, including David Chang, the young superstar chef; the revered Alice Waters; theTop Chefcontestants; and many more.Medium Rawis the deliciously funny, shockingly delectable result, sure to delight philistines and gourmands alike.",

    "review": "&#8230;Bourdain's prose at his wildest can sound like Hunter S. Thompson's, yet he can also produce much quieter work, such as 'My Aim Is True,' a brilliant portrait of Justo Thomas, the man who fillets the fish for Le Bernardin, New York's great seafood restaurant. A.J. Liebling couldn't have done it better. Above all, when you read Bourdain, you never quite know what's going to happen in the next sentence, but you can be sure you're in for a treat, a shock, a surprise&#8230;Anyone who starts the book is liable to lose all control and simply gobble it right up. I certainly did.",
