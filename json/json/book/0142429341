    "review": "In 1985, Lucas Davenport was just a young cop with a well-deserved reputation for playing outside the rules. When his police bosses decided to close the case of two missing Minneapolis girls, he instinctively disagreed, but he was in no position to argue. When, a quarter century later, the victims' skeletal remains turn up at a demolition site, Lucas doesn't hesitate; the hunt is on. A suspenseful novel about long buried truth; a revealing flashback about a popular series crime fighter.",
