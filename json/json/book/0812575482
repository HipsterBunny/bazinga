    "description": "Firekeeper only vaguely remembers a time when she didn't live with her 'family,' a pack of 'royal wolves'-bigger, stronger, and smarter than normal wolves. Now her pack leaders are sending her back to live among the humans, as they promised her mother years ago.Some of the humans think she may be the lost heir to their throne. This could be good-and it could be very, very dangerous. In the months to come, learning to behave like a human will turn out to be more complicated than she'd ever imagined.But though human ways might be stranger than anything found in the forest, the infighting in the human's pack is nothing Firekeeper hasn't seen before. That, she understands just fine. She's not your standard-issue princess-and this is not your standard-issue fairy tale.",

    "review": "Jane Lindskold came to the attention of fantasy fans by finishing two books,DonnerjackandLord Demon, begun by the legendaryRoger Zelaznybefore his tragic death in 1995 at the age of 58, from colon cancer. Lindskold went on to create novels in her own right, and this effort could be described as a historic fantasy with touches of romance, intrigue, and myth. The story centers on Firekeeper, a teenage orphan who has been living in the wilderness with a pack of giant, intelligent wolves. Her world is turned upside down when an expedition arrives looking for the long-lost Prince Barden and his group. The girl, who can 'climb like a squirrel, swim like a fish and outrun a trotting horse,' knows that she must confront the humans to find out more about her mysterious past. After meeting the group, it is speculated that this wild child could be the heir to the throne of Hawk Haven.",
