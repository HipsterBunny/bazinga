    "description": "&#147;There are tales of Middle-earth from times long before The Lord of the Rings, and the story told in this book is set in the great country that lay beyond the Grey Havens in the West&#58; lands where Treebeard once walked, but that were drowned in the great cataclysm that ended the First Age of the World.&#147;In that remote time Morgoth, the first Dark Lord, dwelt in the vast fortress of Angband, the Hells of Iron, in the North; and the tragedy of T&#250;rin and his sister Ni&#235;nor unfolded within the shadow of the fear of Angband and the war waged by Morgoth against the lands and secret cities of the Elves.&#147;Their brief and passionate lives were dominated by the elemental hatred that Morgoth bore them as the children of H&#250;rin, the man who had dared to defy and to scorn him to his face. Against them he sent his most formidable servant, Glaurung, a powerful spirit in the form of a huge wingless dragon of fire. Into this story of brutal conquest and flight, of forest hiding-places and pursuit, of resistance with lessening hope, the Dark Lord and the Dragon enter in direly articulate form. Sardonic and mocking, Glaurung manipulated the fates of T&#250;rin and Ni&#235;nor by lies of diabolic cunning and guile, and the curse of Morgoth was fulfilled.&#147;The earliest versions of this story by J.R.R. Tolkien go back to the end of the First World War and the years that followed; but long afterward, when The Lord of the Rings was finished, he wrote it anew...",

    "review": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewFor fantasy fans young and old, the much-anticipated release of J.R.R. Tolkien'sThe Children of H\u00farin(begun in 1918 and never fully completed) is like the unearthing of a long-lost holy book. The dark, wartorn epic of love and loss, set in the First Age of Middle-earth, is one of Tolkien's three Great Tales of the Elder Days (along with Beren and L&uacute;thien and the Fall of Gondolin), and according to Christopher Tolkien in the novel's preface, it is 'integral' to understanding the complex history of Elves and Men in Middle-earth.While fighting side by side with Elven allies against the evil Morgoth and his minions of Orcs, H\u00farin Thalion -- one of the greatest warriors of the First Age -- is captured and brought back to Morgoth's stronghold, where the Great Enemy places a curse, a 'dark doom,' on the hero and his offspring. Imprisoned atop a mountain peak, H\u00farin is forced to witness the horrific ordeals that beset his son T\u00farin and his daughter NienorEasily the most monumental publishing event of 2007,The Children of H\u00farinis an absolute must-read for fans ofThe HobbitandThe Lord of the Rings,as well as for genre historians and fantasy aficionados alike. Featuring spectacular illustrations from the legendary Alan Lee, Tolkien's oldest -- and arguably darkest -- Middle-earth tale is replete with grand-scale adventure, awe-inspiring magic, and one the most unforgettably heroic (and tragic) story lines genre fans will ever experience. This heartrending tale of T\u00farin and Nienor will undoubtedly become one of the most popular chronicles of Middle-earth. Classic Tolkien.Paul Goat Allen",
