    "review": "Opening with a cute story from when she was seven and  photographed her parents having sex, stand-up comedian Handler  goes on to discuss the virtues of the one-night stand, which  amount to having sex early enough so you're not months into a  relationship before you discover he's into 'anal beads and duct  tape.' She discusses her quest for sex with a 'black man,' which  doesn't work out because the date she finds on  ChocolateSingles.com has a penis so large, she 'would have had  to be the size of the Lincoln Tunnel to accommodate that thing.'  After him, there's a 'little midget,' but she sobers up before  sleeping with him. Next come a number of would-be partners with  penises too small to consider. Finally, there's a guy Handler  does sleep with, only an embarrassing incident involving a  'giant skid mark' prevents her from seeing him again. By the  end, Handler considers settling down with one man, which might  actually net her more sex than these mostly unconsummated  one-night stands. Anyone who laughs at the mere mention of  vaginas and penises may find Handler's book almost as much fun  as getting drunk and waking up in some stranger's bed. Agent,  Michael Broussard Dupree.
