    "review": "In 2000, author Robert Greene published his48 Laws of Power,which quickly became a bestseller. Among the most unlikely of its readers was Curtis James Jackson III, a 25-year-old resident of South Jamaica, Queens, whose distinguished name concealed a rough background including a felony conviction for selling crack cocaine. Jackson, now known worldwide as hip-hop superstar 50 Cent, credits Greene's book with helping him make the transition from self-doomed drug dealer to rapping success. In this book, this unlikely pair teaches readers to put their lives together in an unforgiving world.",
