    "description": "He placed a notice in a Chicago paper, an advertisement for 'a reliable wife.' She responded, saying that she was 'a simple, honest woman.' She was, of course, anything but honest, and the only simple thing about her was her single-minded determination to marry this man and then kill him, slowly and carefully, leaving her a wealthy widow, able to take care of the one she truly loved.What Catherine Land did not realize was that the enigmatic and lonely Ralph Truitt had a plan of his own. And what neither anticipated was that they would fall so completely in love.Filled with unforgettable characters, and shimmering with color and atmosphere,A Reliable Wifeis an enthralling tale of love and madness, of longing and murder.",

    "review": "Don't be fooled by the prissy cover or that ironic title. Robert Goolrick's first novel,A Reliable Wife,isn't just hot, it's in heat: a gothic tale of such smoldering desire it should be read in a cold shower. This is a bodice ripper of a hundred thousand pearly buttons, ripped off one at a time with agonizing restraint. It works only because Goolrick never cracks a smile, never lets on that he thinks all this overwrought sexual frustration is anything but the most serious incantation of longing and despair ever uttered in the dead of night.",
