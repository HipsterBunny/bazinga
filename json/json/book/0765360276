    "description": "From George R. R. Martin&#8217;s Introduction to Warriors&#58; &#160;&#8220;People have been telling stories about warriors for as long as they have been telling stories. Since Homer first sang the wrath of Achilles and the ancient Sumerians set down their tales of Gilgamesh, warriors, soldiers, and fighters have fascinated us; they are a part of every culture, every literary tradition, every genre. All Quiet on the Western Front, From Here to Eternity, and The Red Badge of Courage have become part of our literary canon, taught in classrooms all around the country and the world. Our contributors make up an all-star lineup of award-winning and bestselling writers, representing a dozen different publishers and as many genres. We asked each of them for the same thing&#8212;a story about a warrior. Some chose to write in the genre they&#8217;re best known for. Some decided to try something different. You will find warriors of every shape, size, and color in these pages, warriors from every epoch of human history, from yesterday and today and tomorrow, and from worlds that never were. Some of the stories will make you sad, some will make you laugh, and many will keep you on the edge of your seat.&#8221; &#160;The stories in the second mass market volume of this book are&#58;Introduction&#58; Stories of the Spinner Rack, by George R. R. MartinSeven Years from Home, by Naomi Novik&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;...",

    "review": "For this mammoth collection, 20 award-winning, bestselling authors (including the editors) were commissioned to write original stories about warriors, with no other parameters. The result is an unpredictable assortment, where SF and fantasy rub elbows with mystery, historical, and military fiction, and even a western. The Vikings of Cecilia Holland&rsquo;s &ldquo;The King of Norway,&rdquo; the secret community in Howard Waldrop&rsquo;s WWI tale, &ldquo;Ninieslando,&rdquo; and the rogue AIs in Dozois&rsquo;s own &ldquo;Recidivist&rdquo; provide a little something for everyone. Urban fantasy author Carrie Vaughn turns in &ldquo;The Girls from Avenger,&rdquo; a straight historical piece about female WWII pilots, while historical fantasist Naomi Novik&rsquo;s &ldquo;Seven Years from Home&rdquo; is pure SF. There are a few clunkers, but on the whole, the editors succeed admirably in their mission to break down genre barriers and focus on pure entertainment. (Mar.)",
