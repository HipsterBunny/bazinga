    "review": "Darcy Rhone was more than a pretty face, but she was the last to know it. After her best friend stole her fianc&eacute;, she realizes that relying on the bare essentials ultimately led to loneliness, but she still has to learn how to navigate in a world that's not just there for the taking. In hardcover, Emily Giffin's Something Blue earned high praise for its 'sprightly, dead-on dialogue, real-life complexity and genuine warmth.' Now in mass market paperback and NOOKbook.",
