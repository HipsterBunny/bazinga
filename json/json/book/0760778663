    "description": "A weasel catches a mouse reading under a tree and puts him in a cooking pot. 'WAIT' says the mouse.  'This soup will not taste good.  It has no stories in it.'Mouse then relates four wonderfully fanciful tales with an offbeat cast that includes bees, crickets, two stones, and a thorn bush.Children will savor these fresh, funny stories and the way a clever mouse uses them to fool a gullible weasel and escape the soup pot.A favorite I Can Read Book for almost three decades, this timeless story is perfect for children who are beginning to read or for cozy times spent reading together.Arnold Lobelwas one of the most well-loved creators of award-winning children's books.  He wrote and illustrated more than seventy books for children, including the I Can Read Books UNCLE ELEPHANT, MOUSE TALES, and MOUSE SOUP, and the four Frog and Toad books:  FROG AND TOAD ARE FRIENDS, a Caldecott Honor Book; FROG AND TOAD TOGETHER, a Newbery Honor Book; FROG AND TOAD ALL YEAR; and DAYS WITH FROG AND TOAD.",
