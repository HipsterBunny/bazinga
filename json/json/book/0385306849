    "description": "Saucerful of Secretsis the first in-depth biography of this very private group. At the heart of the saga is Syd Barrett, the group's brilliant founder, whose public decline into shattered incoherence--attributable in part to his marathon use of LSD--is one of the tragedies of rock history. The making ofDark Side of the Moonand Floyd's other great albums is recounted in detail, as are the mounting of &quot;The Wall&quot;&#160;&#160;and the creation of the flying pigs, crashing&#160;&#160;planes, &quot;Mr. Screen&quot; and the other elements of their spectacular stage shows. The book also explores the many battles between bass player/song writer Roger Waters and the rest of the group, leading up to Water's acrimonious departure for a solo&#160;&#160;career in 1984 and his unsuccessful attempt to disolve the group he had left behind.Saucerful of Secretsis an electrifying account of this ground-breaking, mind-bending group, covering every period of their career from&#160;&#160;earliest days to latest recordings. It is full of&#160;&#160;revealing information that will be treasured by all who love Pink Floyd's music.",
