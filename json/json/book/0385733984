    "description": "Can Cameron find what he&#8217;s looking for?All 16-year-old Cameron wants is to get through high school&#8212;and life in general&#8212;with a minimum of effort. It&#8217;s not a lot to ask. But that&#8217;s before he&#8217;s given some bad news&#58; he&#8217;s sick and he&#8217;s going to die. Which totally sucks. Hope arrives in the winged form of Dulcie, a loopy punk angel/possible hallucination with a bad sugar habit. She tells Cam there is a cure&#8212;if he&#8217;s willing to go in search of it. With the help of a death-obsessed, video-gaming dwarf and a yard gnome, Cam sets off on the mother of all road trips through a twisted America into the heart of what matters most.From the Hardcover edition.",
