    "review": "The hijacked yacht is lavish, but for the Somalian pirates, the real prize was the young woman aboard. Nineteen-year-old Cayla Bannock is the daughter of oil heiress Hazel Bannock. Stoking their greed, the kidnappers demand a dizzying twenty billion dollar ransom for her release. Worse yet, world powers seem disinclined to provide any substantive help. Increasingly anxious (for apparently good reason) and with no other options, the mother enlists the help of security company operative Hector Cross to rescue Cayla from the lawless, lascivious monsters. Wilbur Smith (Dark of the Sun; The Sound of Thunder) delivers a high seas, high-risk adventure story.",
