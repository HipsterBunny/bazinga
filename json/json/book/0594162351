Forced into an upcoming buyout by the strugglingLos Angeles Times,he's determined to go out with a bang and a Pulitzer. He's certain that his ticket for fame is Alonzo Winslow, a teenage drug dealer trying to scrape his way out of a homicide and rape indictment. Eager to show how society spawned this killer, McEvoy starts probing more deeply into the case, beginning with Winslow's repudiated confession. The more he finds, the more he's convinced that the real killer is still out there.",
