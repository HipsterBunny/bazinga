    "review": "This modern-day romance narrated by a cynical heroine offers a  balance of wickedly funny moments and universal teen traumas.  High school graduate Remy has some biting commentary about love,  including her romance-writer mother's betrothal to a car dealer  ('He put one hand on my shoulder, Dad-style, and I tried not to  remember all the stepfathers before him that had done the same  thing.... They all thought they were permanent, too') and her  brother's infatuation with self-improvement guru Jennifer Anne.  But when rocker Dexter 'crashes' into her life, her resolve to  remain unattached starts to crack. Readers will need to hold on  to their hats as they accompany Remy on her whirlwind ride,  avoiding, circling and finally surrendering to Cupid's arrows.  Almost as memorable as her summer romance with a heartwarmingly  flawed suitor is the cast of idiosyncratic characters who watch  from the sidelines. There's the trio of Remy's faithful  girlfriends, all addicted to 'Xtra Large Zip' Diet  Cokes practical-minded Jess, weepy Lissa, and Chloe, who shares  Remy's dark sense of humor as well as Dexter's entourage of  fellow band members, as incompetent at managing money as they  are at keeping their rental house clean. Those expecting a  Cinderella finale for Remy will find a twist consistent with the  plot's development. Contrary to any such implication in the  title, this one will keep teens up reading. Ages 12-up. (May)    Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.",
