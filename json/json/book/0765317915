    "description": "The war of Honce drags on, and the roads&#160;and seas are littered with bodies. To everyone&#8217;s stunned disbelief, Yeslnik the Fool has tipped the war&#8217;s scales in his favor. The reign of the newly self-appointed King Yeslnik is already distinguished as the most bloody and merciless in Honce history.Trapped, Dame Gwydre and Father Artolivan concoct a desperate plot to join forces with Laird Ethelbert, the lesser of two vicious evils. But Ethelbert&#8217;s paid assassins slew Jameston Sequin and nearly did the same to Bransen.&#160;Embittered by it all, Bransen&#160;seeks to extricate himself from the selfish goals of all of combatants. But in an odd twist of fate and crossed loyalties, Bransen sees in his old nemesis, Bannagran&#151;the Bear of Honce and the man who slew his adoptive father - a darker image of his own heart. Allies and battle lines become tangled, motives indistinguishable as old friends become enemies and old enemies become allies.",
