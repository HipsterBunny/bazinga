No one is sure who the killer is, or why the victims have been offed, but what is clearis that Stephanie&rsquo;s name is on the killer&rsquo;s list.Short on time to find evidence proving the killer&rsquo;s identity, Stephanie faces further complications when her family and friends decide that it&rsquo;s time for her to choose between her longtime off-again-on-again boyfriend, Trenton cop Joe Morelli, and the bad boy in her life, security expert Ranger. Stephanie&rsquo;s mom is encouraging Stephanie to dump them both and choose a former high school football star who&rsquo;s just returned to town. Stephanie&rsquo;s sidekick, Lula, is encouraging Stephanie to have a red-hot boudoir &ldquo;bake-off.&rdquo; And Grandma Bella, Morelli&rsquo;s old-world grandmother, is encouraging Stephanie to move to a new state when she puts &ldquo;the eye&rdquo; on Stephanie.With a cold-blooded killer after her, a handful of hot men, and a capture list that includes a dancing bear and a senior citizen vampire, Stephanie&rsquo;s life looks like it&rsquo;s about to go up in smoke.The hardcover edition ofSmokin&rsquo; Seventeencontains two smokin&rsquo; hot stickers inside!From the Hardcover edition.",

I'm telling you all this because no plot details are available, but you still know you'll need to buy lots.",
