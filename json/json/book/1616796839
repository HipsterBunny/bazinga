    "review": "A Selection ofBarnes & Noble RecommendsThe village in Quebec where Louise Penny s Chief Inspector \r\nGamache novels are set is home to a bistro, a bookstore, a bed-and-\r\nbreakfast, and a boulangerie. Tantalizing aromas seem to \r\nwaft from every room, and friendship warms the homes of the \r\neccentric collection of people that populates the town, a potpourri \r\nof escaping urbanites, artists, carpenters, and an \r\noutlandish poet with a pet duck.And yet, as Penny s fifth novel unfolds, it isn t \r\nlong before murder disturbs the tranquility of the \r\ncommunity watched over by the graceful trees that \r\ngive Three Pines its name. One Sunday morning, \r\nthe body of a stranger is discovered on the floor \r\nof the town s commercial and spiritual center: \r\nthe bistro run by Olivier Brul\u00e9 and his partner, \r\nGabri. The victim appears to be a stranger -- but is \r\nhe? The answer to that question, and to the more \r\npressing mystery of his killer s identity, soon \r\nrests in the hands of Armand Gamache of the \r\nS\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec.Arriving in Three Pines, a town of old friends and, sadly, new \r\nsuspects, the commanding yet kind Gamache deploys his crew \r\nof detectives to gather evidence in the apparently clueless case. \r\nEach discovery -- a corpse that won t stay still, a house whose \r\nrestoration can t erase the aura of its haunted past, a log cabin \r\nlocated deep in the woods that holds an astonishing collection of \r\npriceless artifacts -- ties another enigmatic knot in the intricate \r\nweb of secrets and deceptions Gamache must unravel.Tellingly blending the social pleasures of a cozy with the \r\nescalating terror of a psychological thriller, Penny traces \r\nGamache s investigation as it expands to encompass cultural \r\ntreasures that range from pieces of the fabled Amber Room \r\nto the china of Catherine the Great, from a first edition ofJane \r\nEyreto the violin of the great Czech composer Bohuslav Martin\u00f9, \r\nfrom the modern art of the museums of Montreal to Haida totem \r\npoles on the mist-enshrouded Queen Charlotte Islands of British \r\nColumbia. With breathless anticipation, the reader follows \r\nGamache as he pursues the shocking and brutal truth hidden in \r\nthe heart of a seemingly loving community.About the AuthorThe Brutal Tellingis Louise Penny s fifth Chief Inspector \r\nArmand Gamache novel.
