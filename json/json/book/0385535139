    "description": "The incomparable master of the legal thriller takes us deeper into the labyrinth that is the American justice system, always drawing us in with an irresistible hook, pull&shy;ing the thread of tension tighter and tighter, and then knocking us out with a conclusion that&rsquo;s never &ldquo;by the book.&rdquo; Maybe that&rsquo;s why, after more than twenty years of consecutive #1New York Timesbest sellers, a new novel by America&rsquo;s favorite storyteller is still a major publishing event.",
