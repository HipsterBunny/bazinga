    "description": "Many .NET developers and many enterprises would like to target iOS devices, yet the learning curve and cost of moving to Objective-C precludes the practicality of this in many cases. MonoTouch brings the best of CocoaTouch and .NET under a single, extensible technology, providing the only way to develop iOS applications using .NET that can be published to the iOS App Store.Learning MonoTouch begins with the basics of building applications for iOS under MonoTouch. It assumes the reader is familiar with C# and .NET at least on an intermediate level and focuses on making use of existing skills, while presenting iOS-specific information in detail. Initial chapters have simple examples to get the reader up and running and to lay the groundwork for more complex samples and subsequent chapters. After the basics are covered, the book quickly moves into more complex examples that address common use cases encountered in iOS development.Learning MonoTouch is for .NET/C# developers with several years of application development experience, but little to no iOS or Mac development experience. This book teaches C#/.NET developers how to take their existing skills to iOS and shows them how to build iOS applications using MonoTouch.Update&#58; Learning MonoTouch will release as an electronic-only edition (ePub, Kindle, Nook, PDF, and Safari Books Online) in July 2011. A print version of this book may become available later in...",
