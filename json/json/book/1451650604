    "review": "This 384-page hardcover collects four novellas about revenge and other traits that most of us strive hard to keep tightly locked. In 'Big Driver,' a vicious attack on the way home from a book club fest leaves a cozy writer with an insatiable thirst for blood. In another story, Darcy Anderson's 'good marriage' loudly collapses with a startling late night discovery in the garage. Another novella charts Dave Streeter's devil deal cancer reprieve, while '1922' rekindles the sudden onslaught of Midwest murder and madness. Trademark Stephen King.",
