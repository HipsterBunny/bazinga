    "review": "Following teacher's orders, Gilbert, a fuzzy-looking woodland creature, inscribes Valentines for his classmates, devising 'nice' rhymes for each. But his bonhomie disappears when he comes to Lewis, who tweaked Gilbert's nose, and Margaret, who teased him about his glasses. As the clever, kid-obliging title attests, Gilbert does not make nice on their cards; to escape the consequences, he signs Margaret's name to Lewis's Valentine and vice versa. Of course, when neither receives a card signed with Gilbert's name, the identity of the prankster is clear. In a predictable resolution to this sweet if minor tale, Gilbert does the right thing and composes friendly Valentines to the two, who apologize for having hurt his feelings. The winning touch here is de Groat's (Annie Pitts, Swamp Monster) characteristically buoyant watercolor art, which features an amiable crew of assorted animals, many festively clad in Valentine's Day-appropriate reds and pinks. Ages 5-up. (Feb.)",
