    "description": "When a father reveals his haunting past, a daughter takes an incredible journey of self-discovery . . . Emmy&#174; award&#8211;winning journalist, TV host, and New York Times bestselling author Rita Cosby has always asked the tough questions in her interviews with the world&#8217;s top newsmakers. Now, in a compelling and powerful memoir, she reveals how she uncovered an amazing personal story of heroism and courage, the untold secrets of a man she has known all her life&#58; her father. Years after her mother&#8217;s tragic death, Rita finally nerved herself to sort through her mother&#8217;s stored belongings, never dreaming what a dramatic story was waiting for her. Opening a battered tan suitcase, she discovered it belonged to her father&#8212;the enigmatic man who had divorced her mother and left when Rita was still a teenager. Rita knew little of her father&#8217;s past&#58; just that he had left Poland after World War II, and that his many scars, visible and not, bore mute witness to some past tragedy. He had always refused to answer questions. Now, however, she held in her hand stark mementos from the youth of the man she knew only as Richard Cosby, proud American&#58; a worn Polish Resistance armband; rusted tags bearing a prisoner number and the words Stalag IVB; and an identity card for an ex-POW bearing the name Ryszard Kossobudzki.

    "review": "Rita Cosby's 2007 bestseller, Blonde Ambition&#58; The Untold Story Behind Anna Nichole Smith's Death generated coast-to-coast headlines and at least one lawsuit. In her new book, she turns to a story much closer to home. In fact, the father mentioned in the subtitle is hers. Quiet Hero describes how her Polish resistance fighter dad escaped from his Nazi captors and then followed the message in a parachuted Hershey bar to freedom. Cosby tells both the rousing story of his WWII experiences and her impassioned efforts to reconstruct his history. (Hand-selling tip&#58; Cosby serves as a popular special correspondent on Inside Edition.)",
