    "review": "At first, Maisie Dobbs thinks that the Charlotte Waite case involves nothing more than a strict father and a runaway heiress. But that first impression dissolves instantly when the lifeless bodies of three of Charlotte's closest friends turn up; each of them poisoned, bayoneted, then left in a crime scene decorated by a white feather. Who committed these mocking murders? Is Charlotte Waite the culprit or merely the next name on the hit list? Maisie Dobbs's second case exhibits her powers of ingenuity and her author's narrative gifts.",
