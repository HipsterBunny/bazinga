    "review": "Witches always look forward to their annual convention, but none of them are more eager to attend this year's annual San Francisco shindig than Rachel Morgan. Condemned to death for black magic, this likeable spellbinder knows that she has only three days to get to Frisco to clear her very bad name. Banned by airport security, she is forced to improvise, which in this case means tagging along with a disturbingly live vampire and an elven tycoon on a secret mission. High-spirited fright nights await readers; bound to be a bestseller.",
