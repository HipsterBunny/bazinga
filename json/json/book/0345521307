    "description": "A deeply evocative story of ambition and betrayal, The Paris Wife captures a remarkable period of time and a love affair between two unforgettable people&#58; Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley.Chicago, 1920&#58; Hadley Richardson is a quiet twenty-eight-year-old who has all but given up on love and happiness&mdash;until she meets Ernest Hemingway and her life changes forever. Following a whirlwind courtship and wedding, the pair set sail for Paris, where they become the golden couple in a lively and volatile group&mdash;the fabled &ldquo;Lost Generation&rdquo;&mdash;that includes Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald.Though deeply in love, the Hemingways are ill prepared for the hard-drinking and fast-living life of Jazz Age Paris, which hardly values traditional notions of family and monogamy. Surrounded by beautiful women and competing egos, Ernest struggles to find the voice that will earn him a place in history, pouring all the richness and intensity of his life with Hadley and their circle of friends into the novel that will become The Sun Also Rises. Hadley, meanwhile, strives to hold on to her sense of self as the demands of life with Ernest grow costly and her roles as wife, friend, and muse become more challenging. Despite their extraordinary bond, they eventually find themselves facing the ultimate crisis of their marriage&mdash;a deception that will lead to the unraveling of everything they&rsquo;ve fought so hard for....",

    "review": "Readers of Ernest Hemingway biographies, his The Sun Also Rises and posthumous memoir A Moveable Feast know at least the outlines of the novelist's relationship with his first wife Hadley Richardson. This rich novel fleshes out that connection, evoking the full rise, throb, and fall of the couple's relationship. As author Paula McClain tells their story, she immerses readers in the jubilation and excesses of Jazz Age, offering us telling glimpses into the lives of the Hemingway's volatile artistic circle. A truly accomplished historical novel; strongly affirmative early reader reports.",
