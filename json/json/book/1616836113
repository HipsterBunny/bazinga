    "description": "In 1975, four teenagers from Mount Temple School in Dublin gathered in a crowded kitchen to discuss forming a band. More than thirty years later, Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton, and Larry Mullen Jr are still together, bound by intense loyalty, passionate idealism, and a relentless belief in the power of rock and roll to change the world.In an epic journey that has taken the band from the clubs of Dublin to the stadiums of the world, U2 has sold more than 130 million albums, revolutionized live performance, spearheaded political campaigns, and made music that defines the age in which we live. Told with wit, insight, and astonishing candor by the band members themselves and manager Paul McGuinness, with pictures from their own archives,U2 by U2allows unprecedented access into the inner life of the greatest rock band of our times.",
