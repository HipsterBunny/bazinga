    "description": "Ancient church rituals meet cutting- edge crime solving in the latest novel in the #1 New York Times&#151;bestselling series that's &ldquo;Law & Order&#58; SVU&#151;in the future&rdquo; (Entertainment Weekly).In the year 2060, sophisticated investigative tools can help catch a killer. But there are some questions even the most advanced technologies cannot answer.Ridley Pearson has praised J. D. Robb's suspense as &ldquo;taut&rdquo; and &ldquo;nerve-jangling.&rdquo; Her latest thriller sets a new standard for suspense, as the priest at a Catholic funeral mass brings the chalice to his lips&#151;and falls over dead.When Detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas confirms that the consecrated wine contained potassium cyanide, she's determined to solve the murder of Father Miguel Flores, despite her discomfort with her surroundings. It's not the bodegas and pawnshops of East Harlem that bother her, though the neighborhood is a long way from the stone mansion she shares with her billionaire husband, Roarke.

    "review": "In the nervous silence of a funeral mass, a Catholic priest slowly brings the chalice to his lips -- and falls over dead, a victim of poisoning. Called in to investigate the ghastly crime, Detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas struggles to make sense of the sparse evidence. Father Miguel Flores seems to have been a clergyman who took his vows of poverty and chastity serious, yet lurking in the backrooms of his previous history are deeds and associates that need to be tracked.  This In Death thriller by Nora Roberts (a.k.a. J.&nbsp;D. Robb) keeps you reading -- and guessing.",
