    "description": "Stephen Sondheim has won seven Tonys, an Academy Award, seven Grammys, a Pulitzer Prize and the Kennedy Center Honors. His career has spanned more than half a century, his lyrics have become synonymous with musical theater and popular culture, and in Finishing the Hat&#8212;titled after perhaps his most autobiographical song, from Sunday in the Park with George&#8212;Sondheim has not only collected his lyrics for the first time, he is giving readers a rare personal look into his life as well as his remarkable productions.Along with the lyrics for all of his musicals from 1954 to 1981&#8212;including West Side Story, Company, Follies, A Little Night Music and Sweeney Todd&#8212;Sondheim treats us to never-before-published songs from each show, songs that were cut or discarded before seeing the light of day. He discusses his relationship with his mentor, Oscar Hammerstein II, and his collaborations with extraordinary talents such as Leonard Bernstein, Arthur Laurents, Ethel Merman, Richard Rodgers, Angela Lansbury, Harold Prince and a panoply of others. The anecdotes&#8212;filled with history, pointed observations and intimate details&#8212;transport us back to a time when theater was a major pillar of American culture. Best of all, Sondheim appraises his work and dissects his lyrics, as well as those of others, offering unparalleled insights into songwriting that will be studied by fans and aspiring songwriters for years to come.

    "review": "Ten years ago, The New York Times was already lauding Stephen Sondheim as 'the Broadway musical's last greatest artist.' Since this talented lyricist made his Great White Way debut in 1957's West Side Story, he has garnered seven Tonys, seven Grammys, an Oscar, and a Pulitzer Prize. Finishing the Hat (which takes its title from a song from Sunday in the Park with George) does what no book before it has&#58; It collects the lyrics for all Sondheim productions from 1957 to 1981. Thus, it contains all his songs for West Side Story, Company, Follies, A Little Night Music, and Sweeney Todd. Just as importantly, this extraordinary book offers rare, even unique glimpses into his career and his creative relationships with Oscar Hammerstein II, Leonard Bernstein, Arthur Laurents, Ethel Merman, Richard Rodgers, Angela Lansbury, and others.",
