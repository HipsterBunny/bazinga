The first snow of the season has fallen. A boy named Jonas wakes in the night to find his mother gone.

As his investigation deepens, something else emerges&#58; he is becoming a pawn in an increasingly terrifying game whose rules are devised&#8212;and constantly revised&#8212;by the killer.Fiercely suspenseful, its characters brilliantly realized, its atmosphere permeated with evil,The Snowmanis the electrifying work of one of the best crime writers of our time.From the Hardcover edition.",
