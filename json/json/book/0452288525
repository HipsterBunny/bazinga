    "description": "A fascinating exploration of the relationship between music and the mind-and the role of melodies in shaping our livesWhether you load your iPod with Bach or Bono, music has a significant role in your life-even if you never realized it. Why does music evoke such powerful moods? The answers are at last becoming clear, thanks to revolutionary neuroscience and the emerging field of evolutionary psychology. Both a cutting-edge study and a tribute to the beauty of music itself,This Is Your Brain on Musicunravels a host of mysteries that affect everything from pop culture to our understanding of human nature, including:* Are our musical preferences shaped in utero?* Is there a cutoff point for acquiring new tastes in music?* What do PET scans and MRIs reveal about the brain's response to music?* Is musical pleasure different from other kinds of pleasure?This Is Your Brain on Musicexplores cultures in which singing is considered an essential human function, patients who have a rare disorder that prevents them from making sense of music, and scientists studying why two people may not have the same definition of pitch. At every turn, this provocative work unlocks deep secrets about how nature and nurture forge a uniquely human obsession.",

    "review": "Musician Daniel Levitin worked in the record industry for many years before his curiosity about our response to music led him into the field of neurobiology. In this delightful guide for non-specialists, he draws on his expertise in both areas to explain the complex connection between music and the human brain. Much of the scientific research cited comes from Levitin's own experimental laboratory at McGill University, but this book is no dry clinical study. Enlivened with witty pop musical references and informed with as much affection as knowledge,This Is Your Brain on Musicis a joyful valentine to one of our deepest and most emotional human instincts.",
