    "review": "Celebrity chef DiSpirito (Rocco Gets Real), a frequent guest judge on The Biggest Loser and Top Chef, shares 'Can't-Live-Without Ingredients' from cauliflower (an excellent replacement for white potatoes), Dijon mustard, and egg whites to fresh herbs, garlic, and Greek yogurt (instead of butter). Each recipe lists fat and calories compared with the average fat and calories for the traditional dish. Lower-calorie brownies, gravy, spaghetti and meatballs, and beef stroganoff will delight readers who have been avoiding favorite foods. DiSpirito does well what Marlene Koch's Eat What You Love attempts, and his name will draw interest.",
