    "review": "Daisy Bellamy has spent much of her young life juggling two men-Logan O'Donnell, the responsible father of their son, and wild military man Julian Gastineaux. She's been in love with Julian for years, but he's so mercurial that they've never been able to give their relationship a real chance. Logan, on the other hand, is reliable, stable, and committed to their son. Daisy and Julian finally decide to take the plunge, but their happiness is cut short when Daisy receives word that Julian has been killed in the line of duty in Colombia. Devastated, she takes a year to move on, marrying Logan in order to give Charlie a stable family. Julian, of course, isn't dead; he's been taken prisoner by a Colombian drug lord, and  he eventually escapes and returns to Daisy, throwing her into a major dilemma. Wiggs's newest (after Summer at Willow Lake) is improbable in the extreme, with thin characters and contrived conflicts engineered to make the reader like Daisy despite her questionable actions.(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.
