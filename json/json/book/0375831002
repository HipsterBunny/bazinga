    "review": "The Barnes & Noble Review fromDiscover Great New WritersAs one of our Discover readers said recently, 'A good book is a good book,' regardless of the audience for which it was written.  In the spirit of that comment, we heartily recommendThe Book Thieffor readers of both the adult and teen persuasions.Australian-born Markus Zusak grew up sitting at the kitchen table, glued to his chair, listening to his mother's tales of her childhood in Nazi Germany.  Such tales would later serve as a springboard for his unusual novel about the power of words to both destroy and  comfort.  A daring work in the adventurous spirit ofThe Shadow of the Wind,this novel has a bizarre narrator: Death.  Drawn into a tense and dangerous historical era, readers discover how Liesel Meminger first learns to read and is transformed into the 'book thief,' stealing books before they can be burned by the Nazis or confiscated from personal libraries.  When her family decides to hide a Jew in the basement, Liesel holds out hope to him in the form of her two most precious commodities: words and stories.  \r\n\r\n(Summer 2006 Selection)",
