NUMA director Dirk Pitt and his children, Dirk. Jr. and Summer, have reason to believe there's a connection here somewhere, but they also know they have very little time to find it before events escalate out of control. Their only real clue might just be a mysterious silvery mineral traced to a long-ago expedition in search of the fabled Northwest Passage.

    "review": "Dirk Pitt returns with another rousing NUMA action thriller. In this high-octane outing, Dirk and his son, Dirk Jr. (neither of whom should be confused with new co-author Dirk Cussler), have to cope with complications from an anti&#150;global warming discovery, a perilous international incident, and a century-old naval expedition. As we have come to expect, Pitt and his cohorts manage to keep us just nanoseconds ahead of widespread destruction. The 20th Dirk Pitt novel is just as refreshing as the first.",
