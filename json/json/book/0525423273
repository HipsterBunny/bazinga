Which is why she is less than thrilled about being shipped off to boarding school in Paris - until she meets Etienne St. Clair&#58; perfect, Parisian (and English and American, which makes for a swoon-worthy accent), and utterly irresistible.

    "review": "Anna is happy with her life in Atlanta. She has a best friend, a good job, and a potential boyfriend. This idyllic life ends when her dad decides to send her to a boarding school in Paris. Despite her fears and worries, Anna adjusts well to Parisian life and ends up making fast friends with Meredith, Josh, St. Clair and Rashmi. The quintet takes in the sights and frequents the cinemas in Paris while squeezing in some time for homework. As the semester progresses, Anna develops a crush on St. Clair and he seems to return those feelings as they both stay at school over Thanksgiving. Complicating the budding relationship is St. Clair's girlfriend, Ellie. As winter turns into spring, St. Clair stays in the comfortable relationship with Ellie instead of venturing into a new relationship with Anna. This confuses and upsets Anna and she acts out by getting drunk at a school party. Things go from bad to worse when she finds out her potential boyfriend in Atlanta has been dating her best friend. But not to fear, by the end of the book Anna and St. Clair are the new hot couple on campus. Most teen girls will overlook the predictable story elements as they root for Anna and St. Clair to finally make their infatuation official. An allusion is made to teen sex, and underage drinking occurs in the novel. Anna and the French Kiss would be a welcome read to those who have finished all the Sarah Dessen and Simone Elkeles books in the library. Reviewer: Charla Hollingsworth",
