    "description": "Bobby is a typical urban New York City teenager--impulsive, eager, restless. For his sixteenth birthday he cuts school with his two best buddies, grabs a couple of slices at his favorite pizza joint, catches a flick at a nearby multiplex, and gets some news from his girlfriend, Nia, that changes his life forever&#58; He's going to be a father. Suddenly things like school and house parties and fun times with friends are replaced by visits to Nia's pediatrician and countless social workers who all say that the only way for Nia and Bobby to lead a normal life is to put their baby up for adoption. Then tragedy strikes Nia, and Bobby finds himself in the role of single, teenage father. Because his child--their child--is all that remains of his lost love.With powerful language and keen insight, Johnson tells the story of a young man's struggle to figure out what the &quot;right thing&quot; is and then to do it. The result is a gripping portrayal of single teenage parenthood from the point of view of a youth on the threshold of becoming a man.",

    "review": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewAuthor Angela Johnson follows up her Coretta Scott King Award&#150;winning novel,Heaven,with this absorbing prequel about a single teen struggling to accept his new paternal role.In chapters that flash between Bobby's relationship with Nia leading up to Feather's birth (entitled 'then') and his life now that he's a father on his own ('now'), Johnson paints an honest, vivid portrait of a man straddling the line between childhood and adulthood. Throughout the book, Bobby fights his own sleep deprivation and desire to hand off Feather to someone else for caretaking, and in one tense episode, he takes off to go spray-painting while his daughter is looked after by a neighbor. Chapter by chapter the events surrounding Bobby's situation become clearer, and after the narrative reaches a pivotal chapter (called 'Nia') that marks Bobby's transformation into single parenthood, the true surprise comes near the end, when we learn what has happened to Feather's mom that eventually spurs Bobby to move to Heaven, Ohio.In a powerful, spare read that will grip you on several levels, Johnson delivers a worthy continuation ofHeaven.The characters' relationship dynamics -- Bobby with Nia, his parents, and Feather -- are deep yet subtle, while the book's main character is one not often found in young adult literature.The First Part Lastis an original read that will stir you to the core.Matt Warner",
