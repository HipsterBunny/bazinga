    "description": "An extraordinary new Spenser novel from the belovedNew York Times-bestselling author.On location in Boston, bad-boy actor Jumbo Nelson is accused of the rape and murder of a young woman. From the start the case seems fishy, so the Boston PD calls on Spenser to investigate. The situation doesn't look good for Jumbo, whose appetites for food, booze, and sex are as outsized as his name. He was the studio's biggest star, but he's become their biggest liability.In the course of the investigation, Spenser encounters Jumbo's bodyguard&#58; a young, former football-playing Native American named Zebulon Sixkill. Sixkill acts tough, but Spenser sees something more within the young man. Despite the odd circumstances, the two forge an unlikely alliance, with Spenser serving as mentor for Sixkill. As the case grows darker and secrets about both Jumbo and the dead girl come to light, it's Spenser-with Sixkill at his side-who must put things right.",

    "review": "This novel arrives as a bittersweet gift&#58; Sixkill is Robert B. Parker's 39th Spenser novel, but it is also his final work; its author having died in January 2010. The crisp precision and ear-perfect dialogue of this thriller will redouble readers' sense of loss. As always, Parker poses questions about both motivations and the identity of culprit. In this case, Spenser's search for the truth behind a case of rape and murder entangles him in the lives of a chronically misbehaving actor and his Native American bodyguard, whose last name gives this fiction its title. One mystery author everyone should know.",
