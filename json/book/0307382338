    "review": "Three women preceded Barbara Marx as Frank Sinatra's wives, but those three failed marriages totaled fewer years than his one successful union, which ended only with the death of the legendary singer/actor in 1998. Lady Blue Eyes, Mrs. Sinatra's long-awaited memoir relives not only the eventful magic of their 22-year marriage, but also the fascinating story of her own rise from small-town Midwestern girl to Las Vegas showgirl; to her first marriage with Marx Brother Zeppo; to her candid takes on their numerous celebrity and politician friends. A moving double portrait.",
