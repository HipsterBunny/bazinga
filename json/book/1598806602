With this book, you&#8217;ll trace Italian culture from Rome&#8217;s Colosseum to Michelangelo&#8217;s David to the bustling elegance of Milan. Experience the art-drenched cities of Venice and Florence, explore the ancient ruins of the Roman Forum, and learn how to avoid the lines at the most popular museums. Discover the villages of Tuscany and Umbria and the lazy rhythms of the Cinque Terre. Shop at local market stalls, sip a cappuccino at an outdoor caf&#233;, and pick up a picknic lunch at an allimentari. Relax and enjoy the life of Bella Italia! Rick&#8217;s candid, humorous advice will guide you to good-value hotels and restaurants. He&#8217;ll help you plan where to go and what to see, depending on the length of your trip.
