    "description": "What will it take to solve the biggest issues of our time&#58; extreme and needless poverty, global warming and environmental degradation, terrorism and the endless cycle of violence, racism, human trafficking, health care and education, and other pressing problems? While Washington offers only the politics of blame and fear, Jim Wallis, the man who changed the conversation about faith and politics, has traveled the country and found a nation hungry for a politics of solutions and hope. He shows us that a revival is happening, as people of faith and moral conviction seek common ground for change.Wallis also reminds us that religious faith was a driving force behind our greatest national reforms, such as the abolition of slavery and the civil rights movement. These 'great awakenings' happened periodically at crucial times in our nation's history to propel us toward the common good. The time is ripe for another movement that will transform this country. WithThe Great Awakening, Wallis helps us rediscover our moral center and provides both the needed inspiration and a concrete plan to hold politics accountable and find solutions to our greatest challenges.",

    "review": "By the count of most religion historians, there have been four Great American Awakenings since Colonial times; the first in the early 18th century, the most recent in the 1960s and '70s. To this tally, Jim Wallis has now added a fifth, which he believes is already underway. The editor of the liberal evangelical magazineSojournerscontends that even in the heartland, Christians are now rallying behind a social justice agenda that is more comprehensive than traditional conservative calls for bans of abortion and gay marriage.  A provocative manifesto for believers.",
