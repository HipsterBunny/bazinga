    "review": "Jay Asher s brilliant first novel is a moving, highly original story that focuses on a set of audiotapes made by a girl before she committed suicide, and which explain to 13 people the reasons why she decided to end her life. Told in a highly effective duel narrative -- alternating between the girl s voice and the thoughts of a boy who is listening -- this honest, poignant story reveals how other people's actions shape, and by extension can ruin, an individual's faith in people. Intensely powerful and painfully real,Thirteen Reasons Whyreveals how brutal high school can be, the consequences of spreading rumors, and the lasting effects of suicide on those left behind.",
