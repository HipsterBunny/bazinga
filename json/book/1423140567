    "review": "'Carter here. Look, we don't have time for long introductions. I need to tell this story quickly, or we're all going to die. If you didn't listen to our first recording, well...pleased to meet you. The Egyptian gods are running loose in the modern world; a bunch of magicians called the House of Life is trying to stop them; everyone hates Sadie and me; and a big snake is about to swallow the sun and destroy the world.' From that nearly breathless beginning, the lynchpin volume of Rick Riordan's Kane Chronicles trilogy descends into even more exciting labyrinths of intrigue and danger. One of the best.",
