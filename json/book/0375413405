    "review": "The book that started it all. WhenMastering the Art of French Cooking, the product of nearly a decade of work, was first released in 1961, it started a revolution.No single cookbook has influenced more chefs or inspired more home cooks to try something ambitious, authentic, and refined on their own. It changed the face of food writing as well, with its precisely detailed instructions and ingredient lists. As Paula Wolfert is quoted as saying in No&euml;l Riley Fitch's biography of Julia Child, 'Just as it's been said that all Russian literature has been taken from Gogol's overcoat, so all American food writing has been derived from Julia's apron.' A tattered copy of the first edition can be found in just about every baby boomer's kitchen.",
