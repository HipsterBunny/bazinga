But when his friends fall prey to Fei Long's diabolical schemes, Akihito has only one person he can turn for help; the person he despises more than anyone else - the Yakuza boss Asami, who once made Akihito his sex slave. How will Asami respond to Akihito? Will he help him? And if he does, what is it going to cost him? What kind of new humiliations are in store for him?",
