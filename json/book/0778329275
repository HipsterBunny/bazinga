    "description": "It&rsquo;s finally time for Dinah Davis to go home. The world-weary correspondent wants to settle down with the sweet guy she left behind in South Carolina&rsquo;s Low Country. Instead, she&rsquo;s confronted by his black-sheep brother, and-despite her longing for serenity-sparks fly.How can she possibly trade her perfectly safe backup plan for a risk-taking guy like Cordell Beaufort after all the dangers she&rsquo;s already faced? But to Dinah&rsquo;s dismay-backup plan or not-her heart has its own ideas.&ldquo;Strong supporting characters, a vivid sense of place, and a strong appreciation for the past add to the appeal of Woods&rsquo; contemporary romance.&rdquo;-Booklist",
