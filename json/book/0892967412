    "description": "Jimmy Fallon is very thankful. And in this first book to come from his TV show, he expresses his gratitude for everything from the light bulb he's too lazy to replace to the F12 button on his computer's keyboard. He thanks microbreweries for making his alcoholism seem like a neat hobby. He thanks the name 'Lloyd' for having two L's. Otherwise it would just sound like 'Loyd.' He thanks the slow-moving family walking in front of him on the sidewalk. Without this 'barricade of idiots,' he might never have been forced to walk in the street and risk getting hit by a car in order to get around them. He's thankful to you, the person reading this right now. It means you're considering buying this book. You should do it. You will be thankful that you did.",

    "review": "Before he became the star of his own late night namesake show, Jimmy Fallon starred on Saturday Night Live for five years. During that stint, he was well known for being unable to keep a straight face during skits. In these simulated thank you notes, however, he manages to keep his authorial tongue firmly planted in cheek while he expresses his 'gratitude' to Miley Cyrus, Hillary Clinton, and hundreds of others. Only you the reader will be laughing uproariously. A paperback original.",
