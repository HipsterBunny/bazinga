    "review": "If she hadn't looked at the picture, Betty Gleeson would have dropped the flyer in the waste paper basket. Instead, she stopped, transfixed: The missing boy in the photo looked identical to her adopted son. This seasoned reporter knew that Will's adoption had been totally aboveboard, but there was something that compelled her to pursue this eerie coincidence. In that moment, she made a decision that would thrust her into a hunt she can't abandon and a struggle she might not survive. Binding family ties; building suspense; sudden surprises.",
