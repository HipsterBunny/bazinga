Orphaned by their mother&#8217;s death in childbirth and their father&#8217;s disappearance, bound together by a preternatural connection and a shared fascination with medicine, the twins come of age as Ethiopia hovers on the brink of revolution. Yet it will be love, not politics &#8212; their passion for the same woman &#8212; that will tear them apart and force Marion, fresh out of medical school, to flee his homeland. He makes his way to America, finding refuge in his work as an intern at an underfunded, overcrowded New York City hospital. When the past catches up to him &#8212; nearly destroying him &#8212; Marion must entrust his life to the two men he thought he trusted least in the world&#58; the surgeon father who abandoned him and the brother who betrayed him.An unforgettable journey into one man&#8217;s remarkable life, and an epic story about the power, intimacy, and curious beauty of the work of healing others.From the Hardcover edition.",

    "review": "Even with its many stories and layers,Cutting for Stoneremains clear and concise. Verghese paints a vivid picture of these settings, the practice of medicine (he is also a physician) and the characters' inner conflicts. I felt as though I were with these people, eating dinner with them even, feeling the hot spongy injera on my fingers as they dipped it into a spicy wot. InThe Interior Castle, Saint Teresa's work on mystical theology, she wrote, 'I began to think of the soul as if it were a castle made of a single diamond or of very clear crystal, in which there are many rooms, just as in Heaven there are many mansions.'Cutting for Stoneshines like that place.",
