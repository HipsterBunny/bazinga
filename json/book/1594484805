    "description": "TheNew York Timesbestseller that gives readers a paradigm- shattering new way to think about motivation.Most people believe that the best way to motivate is with rewards like money-the carrot-and-stick approach. That's a mistake, says Daniel H. Pink inDrive. In this provocative and persuasive new book, he asserts that the secret to high performance and satisfaction-at work, at school, and at home-is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does-and how that affects every aspect of life. He examines the three elements of true motivation- autonomy, mastery, and purpose-and offers smart and surprising techniques for putting these into action in a unique book that will change how we think and transform how we live.",

    "review": "Thomas Friedman called Daniel Pink's A Whole New Mind 'my favorite business book.' Now Pink returns with a deep-digging probe about what really motivates us. Drive challenges us to reject old millennium 'carrot and stick' motivation strategies that no longer. Instead, he prescribes an approach that fulfills three core elements of true motivation&#58; autonomy (the desire to direct our own lives); mastery (the urge to get better and better at something that matters); and purpose (the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.) A seminal work about making us move from the inside. Now in trade paperback and NOOKbook.",
