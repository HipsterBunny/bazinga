But another survivor has a different plan a burning need for retribution and seizes the moment to claim reparation in any form he can find.The Turnaroundtakes us on a journey from the rock-and-soul streets of the '70s to the changing neighborhoods of D.C. today, from the diners and auto garages of the city to the inside of Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the first stop for wounded men and women on their way home from war.  A story of fathers and sons, wives and husbands, loss, victory, and violent redemption,The Turnaroundis another compelling, highly charged novel from George Pelecanos, and proves why 'there's so much praise for his fiction that it's practically become a currency' (Free Lance-Star).",

    "review": "'The bus he had caught was an express,' Mr. Pelecanos writes about how one of the book's losers gets caught up in its inexorable movement toward darkness. But there are others here who are determined to make amends, on the theory that 'you move along in life, you feel the need to make the beds you left undone.' Plain as this is, it's also cogent and powerful, delivered without the preachiness into which Mr. Pelecanos has been known to lapse. He tells a tight, suspenseful story. And he packs enough of a wallop to putThe Turnaroundon an express bus of its own.",
