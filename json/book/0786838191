    "review": "Lockhart's (Dramarama) witty novel about boarding school high jinks of a most cerebral order receives winning treatment from Sirois-her slightly nasal voice for the heroine, 16-year-old Frankie, seems in character and is somehow endearing. Frankie starts her sophomore year with elevated social status thanks to having become the main squeeze of Big Man on Campus Matthew Livingston, but confides her conflicted feelings about being 'arm candy' to roommate Trish, who responds with sweet but Valley Girl-esque befuddlement befitting someone who stays home making fruit crumbles while the boys go out partying. Sirois goes to a deeper register for heartthrob Matthew, leader of the Loyal Order of the Basset Hounds, an all-male secret society Frankie plots to infiltrate, and affects a surfer-dude patois for Alpha, Matthew's sidekick. Sirois preserves the fun in Lockhart's talky novel, largely fueled by the intelligent repartee among its principals. Ages 12-up.Simultaneous release with the Hyperion hardcover (Reviews, Jan 7).(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
