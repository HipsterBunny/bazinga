His father has received a promotion and the family must move from their home to a new house far far away, where there is no one to play with and nothing to do.

    "review": "Through the eyes of an innocent nine-year-old boy named Bruno,  listeners become complicit bystanders, observing some of the  horrors of the Holocaust. Maloney's soft-toned narration and  chipper, believably childlike characterization of Bruno  dramatically bring home the fable-like qualities of Boyne's  moving text. Bruno's limited comprehension of all going on  around him begs listeners, presumably with more knowledge than  the protagonist, to glean the fuller story between the lines.  When his father, an officer for 'the Fury,' as Bruno refers to  him, is transferred from Berlin to a new post in Poland called  'Out-With,' Bruno and his family try to adjust. From his new  bedroom window Bruno can see a fenced-in camp where all the  inhabitants wear striped pajamas. He learns more about this  intriguing place when he befriends a boy inside the camp named  Shmuel (who happens to share Bruno's birthday). Their friendship  progresses dangerously and brings Boyne's tale to a shocking end  that is sure to be a discussion starter. A bonus interview  between Boyne and his editor David Fickling is included. Ages  12-up. (Oct.)   Copyright 2006 Reed Business Information.",
