    "review": "'He is a palindromist, an anagrammatist, an amateur inventor, and, most visibly these days, an ascendant comedian.' This New Yorker accolade was written before Demetri Martin added 'author' to his numerous list of accomplishments. In This Is a Book, the star of Comedy Central's Important Things with Demetri Martin comes center stage with a collection of skits, one-liners, doodles, charts, lists, asides, and all manner of other outlandish frolics. Too funny to put down.",
