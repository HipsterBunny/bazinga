    "description": "The number-oneNew York Times-bestselling author delves into the world of elite firefighters who thrive on danger and adrenaline-men and women who wouldn't know how to live life if it wasn't on the edge.There's little as thrilling as firefighting-at least to Rowan Tripp. The Missoula smoke jumpers are in Rowan's blood&#58; her father is a legend. She's been fighting fires since her eighteenth birthday. At this point, returning to the wilds of Montana for the season feels like coming home-even with reminders of the partner she lost last season still lingering.Fortunately, this year's rookie crop is one of the strongest ever-and Gulliver Curry's one of the best. He's also a walking contradiction, a hotshot firefighter with a big vocabulary and a winter job at a kids' arcade.Everything is thrown off balance when a dark presence lashes out against Rowan, looking to blame someone for last year's tragedy. Rowan knows she can't complicate things with Gull-any distractions in the air or on the ground could mean the end-but if she doesn't find someone she can lean on, she may not make it through the summer. . . .",

    "review": "Some people find the meaning of their life on the beach; others in the office. For second-generation Missoula smoke jumper Rowan Tripp, fire is her element. Not even the death of her partner last year could change that, but this year, there are other complications. One arrives in the well-toned body of rookie firefighter Gulliver Curry. Rowan finds herself deeply drawn, yet puzzled by Gull's enigmatic ways. Her unforeseen passion unnerves her, but there is a closer threat at hand&#58; An arsonist intent on hiding other crimes is loose in the wilderness. Every blaze rustling in the wind brings someone closer to death?. Nora Roberts at her best.",
