    "review": "Nine years ago, Travis Boyette sat contented on the sidelines as an innocent man was condemned to die for the murder he himself had committed. Now, after a mostly useless life, Travis himself is dying of an inoperable brain tumor and the man he passively sent to death row is waiting for his own execution, only four days away. Struck suddenly by tardy conscience, Boyette decides to confess to the homicide. But, with clocks ominously ticking, how can he convince officials that they have the wrong man? John Grisham at the top of his form. Another Barnes & Noble Bestseller, now in a mass market paperback and NOOK Book.",
