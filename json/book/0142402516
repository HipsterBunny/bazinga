    "review": "Barnes & Noble Review from Discover Great New WritersA deeply affecting coming-of-age story,Looking for Alaskatraces the journey of Miles Halter, a misfit Florida teenager who leaves the safety of home for a boarding school in Alabama and a chance to explore the 'Great Perhaps.'  Debut novelist and NPR commentator Green perfectly captures the intensity of feeling and despair that defines adolescence in this hip, shocking, and emotionally charged work of fiction.Miles has a quirky interest in famous people's last words, especially Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais's final statement, 'I go to seek a Great Perhaps.'  Determined not to wait for death to begin a similar quest, Miles convinces his parents to let him leave home.  Once settled at Culver Creek Preparatory School, he befriends a couple of equally gifted outcasts: his roommate Chip -- commonly known as the Colonel -- who has a predilection for memorizing long, alphabetical lists for fun; and the beautiful and unpredictable Alaska, whom Miles comes to adore.The kids grow closer as they make their way through a school year filled with contraband, tests, pranks, breakups, and revelations about family and life.  But as the story hurtles toward its shattering climax, chapter headings like 'forty-six days before' and 'the last day' portend a tragic event -- one that will change Miles forever and lead him to new conclusions about the value of his cherished 'Great Perhaps.'\r\n(Summer 2005 Selection)",
