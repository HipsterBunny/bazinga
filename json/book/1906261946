    "description": "The Michelin Green Guide is the authority on Japan today and the forces of nature and society that have shaped it. Michelin's local writers have walked, driven, visited, slept, shopped and eaten through every tour, site, hotel, restaurant, boutique, cafe and venue in the guide. Where they have stepped, we won't put a foot wrong. Green Guide Japan is meticulously updated and beautifully illustrated with full-color photographs, scores of Michelin maps and insider coverage of shopping, nightlife, accommodation and restaurants.",
