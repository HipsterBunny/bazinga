    "review": "The much anticipated Awakened, book eight in the House of Night series, picks up where Burned (St. Martin's, 2010/VOYA October 2010) left off. Though both bear scars from their journey, Zoey and Stark return from the Otherworld bonded, body and soul. Their love and loyalty are pure, an antithesis to Neferet and Kalona's depraved alliance. Neferet, still scheming to bring down Zoey Redbird and all that she stands for, enslaves Kalona's immortal soul for his inability to keep Zoey's soul shattered in Nyx's Realm. Kalona's son is not much better off, skulking in the shadows and fighting his imprint with the red High Priestess, Stevie Rae. Born of hatred and rage, Rephaim cannot reconcile his feelings for her with his monstrous nature. All are at a crossroads and must choose their paths; ultimately, their decisions will affect the outcome of the war between dark and light. The costs are high for such a battle, so the question remains: can Zoey and her friends stand to lose more than they already have? The narrative unfolds at blistering speed. Told from alternating points of view, the novel allows readers new insights into characters' internal conflicts. Exploring themes of social responsibility, integrity, and loss and mortality, the novel does not shy away from difficult subject matter. The friends lose loved ones and the consequences and resulting grief for such loss are explored. Overall, this is a satisfying continuation of the series; readers are left with just enough unanswered questions to keep them clamoring for the next installment. Reviewer: Courtney Huse Wika",
