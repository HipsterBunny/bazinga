    "description": "A revealing insider's account of Led Zeppelin's 1975 North American tour from the bestselling author ofHammer of the Gods.As a young music journalist in 1975, Stephen Davis got the opportunity of a lifetime&#58; an invitation to cover the sold-out 1975 North American tour of Led Zeppelin for a national magazine. He received a backstage pass, was granted interviews with band members, and even got a prized seat on the band's luxurious tour jet, The Starship. While on duty, he chronicled the Zeppelin tour in three notebooks, but after writing his article in 1975 he misplaced them. Three decades later, he finally found the notebooks and unearthed a vivid account of the band members' extravagant, and often troubled, lives on tour.Tied together by Davis's entertaining narrative, and including more than forty never-before-published photographs,LZ-'75is an unprecedented and comprehensive personal portrait of the greatest (and most notoriously press-shy) rock band in history at its apex.",

    "review": "A decade before Stephen Davis wrote his Hammer of the Gods&#58; The Led Zeppelin Saga (9780061473081), he covered the group's sold-out 1975 North American tour for a national magazine. For a young rock music journalist, it was a dream assignment, complete with backstage passes, exclusive interviews, and even a seat on the band's tour jet. While on the road, he filled three notebooks with on-the-spot details; then, almost promptly, lost them. This primary document, recovered after more than three decades, and now reshuffled, annotated, and embellished with photographs forms the heart of a Led Zeppelin book that captures the superstar group in their prime.",
