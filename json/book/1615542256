    "description": "One of the most celebrated and controversial authors in America delivers his first novel&#8212;a sweeping chronicle of contemporary Los Angeles that is bold, exhilarating, and utterly original.Dozens of characters pass across the reader's sight lines&#8212;some never to be seen again&#8212;but James Frey lingers on a handful of LA's lost souls and captures the dramatic narrative of their lives&#58; a bright, ambitious young Mexican-American woman who allows her future to be undone by a moment of searing humiliation; a supremely narcissistic action-movie star whose passion for the unattainable object of his affection nearly destroys him; a couple, both nineteen years old, who flee their suffocating hometown and struggle to survive on the fringes of the great city; and an aging Venice Beach alcoholic whose life is turned upside down when a meth-addled teenage girl shows up half-dead outside the restroom he calls home.Throughout this strikingly powerful novel there is the relentless drumbeat of the millions of other stories that, taken as a whole, describe a city, a culture, and an age. A dazzling tour de force,Bright Shiny Morningilluminates the joys, horrors, and unexpected fortunes of life and death in Los Angeles.",
