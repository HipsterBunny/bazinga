    "review": "A boat full of critters get ready for bed in this oversized board book from Sandra Boynton! With zippy yet serene artwork that's sure to make any Boynton fan feel comforted for sleep time, this before-bed read follows an elephant, dog, pig, and other animals as they 'take a bath in one big tub with soap all over -- SCRUB SCRUB SCRUB,' put on their pj's, and crowd around the sink brushing their teeth. Of course, they can't forget a little exercise as part of their routine, and afterwards, when 'The moon is high. The sea is deep. They rock and rock and rock to sleep.' Boynton's relaxing words and bedtime palette -- which includes dark pastels and other nighttime colors -- combine to make a winning book that should make those eyelids a little bit heavier. Perfect for reading to your child and a fun complement to other Boynton books likeSnoozersandPajama Time!",
