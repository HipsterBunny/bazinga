    "review": "Author Gary Shteyngart might have the most memorable name, but the author of Absurdistan continues to roll out wild dystopian novels that unnerve you even while you're laughing. Super Sad True Love Story belies almost every word of its title, but it still plunges us into a satirical realm that we can recognize if we open our eyes widely. Restless, middle-aged, maladjusted Lenny Abramov and young Eunice Park, his somewhat reluctant old-fashioned love interest alternate as narrators, each of them projecting a slightly twisted view of an even more twisted reality. A refreshing satirical romp for hip fiction readers.",
