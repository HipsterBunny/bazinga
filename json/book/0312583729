    "description": "Is this what&#8217;s in store?June 12, 2030 started out like any other day in memory&#8212;and by then, memories were long.&#160; Since cancer had been cured fifteen years before, America&#8217;s population was aging rapidly.&#160; That sounds like good news, but consider this&#58; millions of baby boomers, with a big natural predator picked off, were sucking dry benefits and resources that were never meant to hold them into their eighties and beyond.&#160; Young people around the country simmered with resentment toward &#8220;the olds&#8221; and anger at the treadmill they could never get off of just to maintain their parents&#8217; entitlement programs.But on that June 12th, everything changed&#58; a massive earthquake devastated Los Angeles, and the government, always teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, was unable to respond.&#160;The fallout from the earthquake sets in motion a sweeping novel of ideas that pits national hope for the future against assurances from the past and is peopled by a memorable cast of refugees and billionaires, presidents and revolutionaries, all struggling to find their way.&#160; In 2030, the author&#8217;s all-too-believable imagining of where today&#8217;s challenges could lead us tomorrow makes gripping and thought-provoking reading.",

    "review": "With2030Mr. Brooks has made the nervy move of transposing his worrywart sensibility from film to book. Two things are immediately apparent about his debut novel: that it's as purposeful as it is funny, and that Mr. Brooks has immersed himself deeply in its creation.2030is an extrapolation of present-day America into the not-so-distant future, and it is informed by the author's surprisingly serious attention to reality. Unlike the fantasy writer who foresees a gee-whiz future full of alluring gimmicks, Mr. Brooks has dreamed up escapism about problems we cannot escape.",
