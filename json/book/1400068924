    "review": "From the onset, the rapper known as Jay-Z was fighting destiny. Growing in a Bedford Stuyvesant house project; abandoned by his father; when he was just 12, he shot his older brother when he caught him stealing jewelry; three years later, he was selling crack on the streets. Mercifully he had an obsession.' 'Everywhere I went I'd write. If I was a crossing a street with my friends and a rhyme came, I'd break out my binder, spread it on a mailbox or lamppost and write the rhyme.... Even back then, I thought I was the best, writing dozens of rhymes about how I was the king of hip-hop.' This autobiography describes how that obsession became a reality.",
