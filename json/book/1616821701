    "review": "When most of us think of corsairs, we imagine swashbuckling pirates of the Johnny Depp variety. The Islamist terrorist corsairs that populate Clive Cussler's Oregon Files novel, however, resemble nothing seen before. Juan Cabrillo's interest in them originates in a plane crash and a top-level disappearance; the abduction or murder of the U.S. secretary of state propels the Oregon team on a near-frantic race that involves ancient manuscripts and a modern cabal. Full-throttle Cussler.",
