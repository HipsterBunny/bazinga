    "review": "This is the story of Dylan and the relationships he has with the girl he loves, his best friend, and his father. Told partially in flashbacks and augmented by passages from a death row prisoner's memoir, it is fast-paced, complex and interesting&#151;until it isn't. The storyline about how Dylan became so indebted to his best friend Wade that he risks his relationships and freedom to help him is the second best part of the book. The true best part comes toward the end, when Dylan reunites with his father and begins to learn to truth about what happened on the night his father was accused of murder. All of the dialogue, scenarios and feelings expressed by the characters, particularly Dylan's grandmother, ring true and seem poignant from this point on through the end. It is a startling contrast to the pages dedicated to Dylan's relationship with Jess. The relationship that should form the center of the book feels unrealistic and forced next to the relationships Dylan has with his dad and Wade. Reviewer: Jennifer Waldrop",
