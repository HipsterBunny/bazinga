    "description": "Haunted Heartlandis a compendium of the unbelievable and the fantastic: ghosts, haunted houses, possessions and exorcisms, vanishing people, mysterious lights, spontaneous combustions, poltergeists, and dreams of premonition.AuthorsBeth ScottandMichael Normanhave collected over 150 true 'ghost stories' from America's Heartland: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Wisconsin. What is perhaps most striking aboutHaunted Heartlandis that each of the stories originated in these supposedly peaceful states. From haunted mansions in Ohio to a Nebraska classroom lost in time, and from haunted manganese mines in northern Minnesota to ancient specters wandering the Ozark hills of Missouri, Scott and Norman lay to rest the notion that hauntings occur only in moss-draped southern plantations or shuttered, clapboard cottages along the Maine coast.All of the incidents have been reported as fact to the authors. Whatever the tale or whatever the locale, the stories inHaunted Heartlandwill cause you to stop and ponder the perplexing world of the supernatural.",
