    "review": "Excited to raise money for the school library, Nancy decides to bake scrumptious cupcakes to sell at the bake sale. (Scrumptious means very delicious.) Shopping for baking supplies, Nancy reminds Mom not to forget the sprinkles and candy toppings. No plain cupcakes for this girl! The homey scene of a family baking together is charming. Little sister is sampling the batter, mom looks frazzled, and Nancy is in decorating heaven. Disaster strikes as Frenchy, the dog, demolishes the cupcakes since Nancy didn't listen to Mom about putting the cupcakes in a safe place. Then Dad comes home carrying a bag of baking supplies for guess what? Cupcakes! Apparently nobody listens in this family since Mom and Dad both thought the other was to purchase cupcake ingredients. A new batch of cupcakes is baked and is a big seller at the bake sale. Readers will want a sweet treat by the time they finish reading. Gaudy illustrations will appeal to beginning readers who will delight in this latest installment of the 'Fancy Nancy.' Series. A glossary of fancy words is provided for readers for vocabulary enrichment. Reviewer: Nancy Baumann",
