    "description": "&ldquo;How much of this blood is his?&rdquo;&ldquo;Most of it, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; a second woman said as they both rushed along beside him.As Richard fought to focus his mind on his need to remain conscious, the breathless voices sounded to him as if they were coming from some great dim distance. He wasn&rsquo;t sure who they were. He knew that he knew them, but right then it just didn&rsquo;t seem to matter.The crushing pain in the left side of his chest and his need for air had him at the ragged edge of panic. It was all he could do to try to pull each crucial breath.Even so, he had a bigger worry.Richard struggled to put voice to his burning concern, but he couldn&rsquo;t form the words, couldn&rsquo;t get out any more than a gasping moan. He clutched the arm of the woman beside him, desperate to get them to stop, to get them to listen. She misunderstood and instead urged the men carrying him to hurry, even though they already panted with the effort of bearing him over the rocky ground in the deep shade among the towering pines. They tried to be as gentle as possible, but they never dared to slow.Not far off, a rooster crowed in the still air, as if this were an ordinary morning like any other.Richard observed the storm of activity swirling around him with an odd sense of detachment.

    "review": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewWith only one installment left until Terry Goodkind's mammoth Sword of Truth series concludes, the jaw-dropping revelations inPhantom-- the tenth novel in the epic fantasy and the second volume in the Chainfire trilogy -- sets the stage for an equally thrilling and bittersweet finale that readers have been anticipating for more than a decade. (The first volume of the Sword of Truth,Wizard's First Rule,was released in 1994.)As the Seeker of Truth Richard Rahl continues to look for his wife, Kahlan, and somehow free her from the Chainfire spell -- which, in essence, has made her invisible to those around her and has erased her from the memories of everyone who knew her -- she is unwillingly traveling with three malevolent Sisters of the Dark en route to a destiny that has the potential 'to unravel the world itself.' On his quest, however, Richard is forced to accept some grim realizations: As he is chasing a phantom and trying to save one person, the rest of the world is descending into unimaginable horror. Emperor Jagang and the sadistic Imperial Order forces are on the verge of subjugating the entire New World and the powerful magic that once flowed across the realm has been tainted and is corrupting everything it comes in contact with. 'It's as if all that was this world is passing into a realm of mere legend 'One of the most ambitious fantasy sagas ever undertaken,Phantomincludes bombshells that will have Sword of Truth fans practically climbing the walls in anticipation for the 11th and final volume. You want the Truth? You can't handle the Truth!Paul Goat Allen",
