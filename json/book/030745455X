    "description": "Mikael Blomkvist, crusading journalist and publisher of the magazineMillennium,has decided to run a story that will expose an extensive sex trafficking operation between Eastern Europe and Sweden, implicating well-known and highly placed members of Swedish society, business, and government.But he has no idea just how explosive the story will be until, on the eve of publication, the two investigating reporters are murdered. And even more shocking for Blomkvist&#58; the fingerprints found on the murder weapon belong to Lisbeth Salander&#8212;the troubled, wise-beyond-her-years genius hacker who came to his aid inThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,and who now becomes the focus and fierce heart ofThe Girl Who Played with Fire.As Blomkvist, alone in his belief in Salander&#8217;s innocence, plunges into an investigation of the slayings, Salander herself is drawn into a murderous hunt in which she is the prey, and which compels her to revisit her dark past in an effort to settle with it once and for all.From the Hardcover edition.",

    "review": "The Girl Who Played with Fireconfirms the impression left byDragon Tattoo.Here is a writer with two skills useful in entertaining readers royally: creating characters who are complex, believable and appealing even when they act against their own best interest; and parceling out information in a consistently enthralling way. The sharp-eyed may catch Larsson leaning on coincidence a bit too often in the new book, but overall his storytelling is so assured that he can get away with these peccadilloes.",
