    "review": "John Flanagan began the Ranger's Apprentice as a series of short stories, designed only to whet his son's appetite for reading. It was only ten years later, in 2004, that he published the first installment as a book. Now, ten episodes later, children in more than a dozen countries are grateful that the Australian author took his adventure fantasy more public. In The Emperor of Niho Ja, Will, Alyss, and Evanlyn venture thru pirate-infested seas into the unknown dangers of Nihon-Ja to save their beloved old friend. The concluding installment of a series that has won repeated praise for its arresting suspense and its down-to-earth hero.",
