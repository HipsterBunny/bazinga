    "review": "This is a coffee-table book. I almost wrote coffee cake after looking at 1000 luscious pictures of dessert decoration. The photos are thematically separated, which makes it easy for someone looking for decoration ideas for events such as baby showers and holiday-specific celebrations. The page layout, with attention to color families, is beautiful. There are a few frosting recipes in the back of the book, but that's it in terms of substantive content beyond the photographs.I Would Give This to Friends who are into cake decorating or anyone looking for ideas to give to bakers for special orders.
