    "review": "From its title onward, the spirit of Gwyneth Paltrow's father permeates this book&#58; 'I will never forget how concentrated he looked in the kitchen, it almost looked like a grimace or a frown if you didn't know him. He practiced incredible care and precision when he was preparing food. It was as if the deliciousness of the food would convey the love he felt in direct proportion.' That attentiveness and family warmth is an ever-present component of the Oscar-winning actress' sumptuous new cookbook. My Father's Daughter contains 150 recipes artfully adjusted from several world cuisines and presented with unusually meticulous cooking instructions. Separate chapters cover pantry provisions; soups; salads; burgers & sandwiches; pastas; main courses; side dishes; breakfast; and desserts.",
