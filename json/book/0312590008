    "description": "Veteran rock journalist Mick Wall unflinchingly tells the story of the band that pushed the envelope on both creativity and excess, even by rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll standards. Led Zeppelin was the last great band of the 1960s and the first great band of the 1970s&#8212;andWhen Giants Walked the Earthis the full, enthralling story of Zep from the inside, written by a former associate of both Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. Rich and revealing, it bores into not only the disaster, addiction and death that haunted the band but also into the real relationship between Page and Plant, including how it was influenced by Page&#8217;s interest in the occult. Comprehensive and yet intimately detailed,When Giants Walked the Earthliterally gets into the principals&#8217; heads to bring to life both an unforgettable band and an unrepeatable slice of rock history.",

    "review": "Simon Vance transports the listener back in time to the dawn of heavy metal in rock journalist Wall&rsquo;s biography of the legendary Led Zeppelin. Tracing the origins and history of the band and its members&mdash;from the early days with the Yardbirds to the birth and global conquest of the Mighty Zeppelin&mdash;Vance delivers a gritty performance that captures the spirit of both the band and the late 1960s. Although Wall&rsquo;s portrait is often unpalatably sycophantic&mdash;particularly unfortunate are the melodramatic sections told in the second person&mdash;Vance&rsquo;s range of voices and lively, spirited narration enliven the detailed history of the band and the private lives of Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Bonham, and John Paul Jones. A must for die-hard Zeppelin fans only, this audiobook, with its 18 hours of smitten zealotry, may prove too much for the casual listener. A St. Martin&rsquo;s hardcover (Reviews, Sept. 14). (Nov.)",
