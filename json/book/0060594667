    "description": "Tom Franklin's extraordinary talent has been hailed by the leading lights of contemporary literature&#151;Philip Roth, Richard Ford, Lee Smith, and Dennis Lehane. Reviewers have called his fiction 'ingenious' (USA Today) and 'compulsively readable' (Memphis Commercial Appeal). His narrative power and flair for character-ization have been compared to the likes of Harper Lee, Flannery O'Connor, Elmore Leonard, and Cormac McCarthy. Now the Edgar Award-winning author returns with his most accomplished and resonant novel so far&#151;an atmospheric drama set in rural Mississippi. In the late 1970s, Larry Ott and Silas '32' Jones were boyhood pals. Their worlds were as different as night and day&#58; Larry, the child of lower-middle-class white parents, and Silas, the son of a poor, single black mother. Yet for a few months the boys stepped outside of their circumstances and shared a special bond. But then tragedy struck&#58; Larry took a girl on a date to a drive-in movie, and she was never heard from again. She was never found and Larry never confessed, but all eyes rested on him as the culprit. The incident shook the county&#151;and perhaps Silas most of all. His friendship with Larry was broken, and then Silas left town. More than twenty years have passed. Larry, a mechanic, lives a solitary existence, never able to rise above the whispers of suspicion. Silas has returned as a constable. He and Larry have no reason to cross paths until another girl disappears...",

    "review": "Franklin, an Edgar-winning writer of atmospheric tales, deserves an audience to match the praise he's attracted forPoachers, Hell at the BreechandSmonk.If you're looking for a smart, thoughtful novel that sinks deep into a Southern hamlet of the American psyche,Crooked Letter, Crooked Letteris your next book&#8230;Franklin first attracted attention as a short story writer, and you can see that skill in this well-crafted tale, which despite all the historical and psychological ground it covers, finishes up in a tight 272 pages. The terror of a quiet oddball is a thread-worn plot, of course, but this is a novel that spells out something else entirely.",
