    "review": "Alexandra 'Zan' Moreland has lost her identity. No, it's not temporary amnesia; the attractive Manhattan interior designer has had her identity stolen and we're not talking about just credit cards or bank accounts. An unknown person is impersonating Zan and plotting to identify her as the kidnapper of her own child. Mary Higgins Clark's latest novel pits one desperate woman against unseen enemies and even against her own doubts about her sanity. Prime time crime and suspense.",
