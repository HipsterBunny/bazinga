    "description": "Year after year, hundreds of millions of visitors spend more than a billion hours enjoying the magnificent, astonishingly diverse realm overseen by America&#8217;s National Park Service. And the National Geographic Society has been involved with this forward-looking, environmentally-minded department from the very beginning.This extensive travel planner covers not just the 58 official National Parks but also the nearly 350 additional properties in the Park Service&#8217;s domain. The premier Parks are described in detail, but equal attention is given to the National Monuments, Memorials, Preserves, Historic Sites, Battlefields, Cemeteries, and Seashores, not to mention a network of &quot;National Trails&quot; and even the intriguingly referred to &quot;Affiliated Areas.&quot; From Yellowstone to the Statue of Liberty, from the hallowed ground of Gettysburg National Military Park to the Pacific waters shrouding Hawaii&#8217;s U.S.S.ArizonaMemorial, this catalog spans American history and territory both, with practical advice on how to reach each park, when to go, and what to do there.",
