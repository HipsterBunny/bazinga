    "review": "The authors of Hello, Cupcake are back, this time with the promise of simpler recipes. Relying on doctored, store-bought cake mixes and the option of canned frostings, recipe time is used primarily for assembling and decorating cupcakes that take the form of animals, food items, and holiday-inspired scenes. The TOC may leave readers guessing recipe selections with chapter names such as &ldquo;I Thought You Ordered Chocolate Moose&rdquo; and &ldquo;The House that Boo Built,&rdquo; but the unconventional names embody the playful spirit of this title. Basic techniques, including filling cupcake liners and frosting cupcakes, are explained, and recipes are formatted into clear, easy-to-understand numbered steps accompanied by full-color photos. Kids and adults alike will find joy in the many artful creations, including a &ldquo;pizza&rdquo; supported by cupcakes and topped with fruit &ldquo;pepperoni&rdquo;; a banana split with cupcakes in the form of ice cream scoops, and Chinese takeout complete with Tootsie Roll broccoli florets. This is an innovative title that doesn't hold back. (Apr.)",
