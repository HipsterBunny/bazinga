    "review": "Two years ago, Caleb claimed responsibility for a drunken hit-and-run accident leaving Maggie, best friend to his twin sister, Leah, with a permanently impaired leg. Now eighteen and home from juvenile detention, his friends' animosity, family's breakdown, and subsequent messy romance with Maggie convince him everyone would benefit from his absence, so he abruptly flees and ceases all communication. Caleb resurfaces some eight months later, after hitting rock bottom, and reluctantly contacts his juvenile counselor for help. Assistance means warily entering ReSTART, a program where those affected by teen reckless driving share their stories and drastically changed lives with high-risk adolescents. Caleb and Maggie's emotions freefall upon discovering each other in the program, especially as each is keeping the same secret: Leah caused the accident, with Caleb uninvolved but rashly promising to protect her. Caleb hardly suspects that Maggie has surmised the truth, but she realizes everyone's healing is dependent upon Leah's truthfulness and wants the silence ended. She is, however, uncertain how to approach the volatile subject. Alternately narrated by Caleb and Maggie, this utterly realistic story is engrossing, especially the thorny relationships and fractured families. The plot continually progresses, allowing the characters' growth in increasingly complicated situations, with compelling interactions among other ReSTART members and speaking audiences. Readers will probably find the ending either sappy or swoon-worthy, but plausible. Although promoting automobile safety, the larger message demonstrates that one careless lie, regardless of intention, can be more devastating and permanent than the tragic consequences of hazardous teen driving.
