    "review": "Vera Dietz is every teenager, yet she is uniquely herself. The abandoned daughter of a runaway mother, Vera lives with her accountant father who is himself a study in contradictions. An accountant who spouts Zen platitudes, he parents Vera with the firm conviction that steering her away from the pitfalls that tripped him up as a teenager is the only way to save her from herself. Yet, he also shoves her out of the nest and into the adult world of work early in her teen years. Vera rebels against the strict rules and constant warnings. Told not to drink, she becomes a binge drinker. Told not to befriend Charlie Kahn, she falls in love with him only to lose him to the more promiscuous and psychotic Jenny. In alternating voices and viewpoints, the story reveals Charlie and Vera's relationship and Vera and her father's relationship, Vera and her mother's antagonism, and the intermittent voice of Charlie, dead and begging for vindication for the incidents surrounding his death. The plot is complex and the characters are intricate, many-faceted and tragically, humanly flawed. In many ways, this is a psychological thriller as Vera's inner torments play out in dreams and hallucinations of Charlie. Her eventual understanding that her father is actually in her corner is a dawning of maturity, yet she teaches him, as well, that he cannot turn his back on the abuse and dysfunction that produced Charlie's emotional wounds. This is a book for mature teens as there are discussions of pornography and fetishism, but given the right reader, this is a page-turner to be savored and discussed. Reviewer: Lois Rubin Gross",
