    "description": "Now in paperback, Jimmy Page&#58; Magus, Musician, Man is the first-ever biography of Led Zeppelin's legendary guitarist and producer. Never before has the story been told in such sharp detail, leaving no stone unturned, from the heady days of swinging London in the 1960s - when Page was lighting up the scene as an incendiary session man - through the bombast, beauty, and blues that is Led Zeppelin (not to mention the wanton sex and drug orgies that would come to define rock excess). Here is the story of rock's most enigmatic and influential icon. 'This biog is a cut above.' - MOJO",
