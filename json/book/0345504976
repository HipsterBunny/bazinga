    "review": "While it relies at times on convention,The Passageis astutely plotted and imaginative enough to satisfy the most bloodthirsty reader&#8230;Cronin leaps back and forth in time, sprinkling his narrative with diaries,  e-mail messages, maps, newspaper articles and legal documents. Sustaining such a long book is a tough endeavor, and every so often his prose slackens into inert phrases&#8230;For the most part, though, he artfully unspools his plot's complexities, and seemingly superfluous details come to connect in remarkable ways.",
