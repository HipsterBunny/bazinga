    "description": "This hands-on companion presents in session-by-session replicable detail the clinical strategies designed to remediate four specific skills areas arrested in the BPD patient: 'mindfulnesss' (balancing emotion and rationality to achieve wisdom), interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance. A vital component in Dr. Linehan's comprehensive treatment program, the manual also features practical pointers on when to use the other treatment strategies described in Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment Currently employed in a variety of inpatient and outpatient settings, this user-friendly manual provides everything a clinician needs. It includes 'lecture notes,' discussion questions, exercises, and practical advice on what problems are likely to arise and how best to deal with them. Published in a large 8 1/2' x 11' format, it also features an array of client handouts that may be readily photocopied. Originally written for skills training groups, the manual can also be used with individual patients.",
