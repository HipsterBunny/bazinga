    "description": "The real story of the crash began in bizarre feeder markets where the sun doesn't shine and the SEC doesn't dare, or bother, to tread&#58; the bond and real estate derivative markets where geeks invent impenetrable securities to profit from the misery of lower- and middle-class Americans who can't pay their debts. The smart people who understood what was or might be happening were paralyzed by hope and fear; in any case, they weren't talking.Michael Lewis creates a fresh, character-driven narrative brimming with indignation and dark humor, a fitting sequel to his #1 bestsellerLiar's Poker. Out of a handful of unlikely-really unlikely-heroes, Lewis fashions a story as compelling and unusual as any of his earlier bestsellers, proving yet again that he is the finest and funniest chronicler of our time.",

    "review": "Unfortunately, truth frequently outflanks fiction. The most glaring recent of that is, of course, the Recession of 2007-2008, a catastrophic domino-fall set in motion by the actions (and conspicuous inactions) of an embarrassing number of players and regulators. In The Big Short, Moneyball author Michael Lewis tracks these long-festering events with precise details and macabre wit, revealing how self-serving myopia and naked greed fueled the most catastrophic economic crisis since the Great Depression. A Barnes & Noble Bestseller in hardcover; now in paperback and NOOKbook.",
