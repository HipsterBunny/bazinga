    "description": "Q&#58; What is this book about? A&#58; Well, that&#8217;s difficult to say. I haven&#8217;t read it yet&#8212;I&#8217;ve just picked it up and casually glanced at the back cover. There clearly isn&#8217;t a plot. I&#8217;ve heard there&#8217;s a lot of stuff about time travel in this book, and quite a bit about violence and Garth Brooks and why Germans don&#8217;t laugh when they&#8217;re inside grocery stores. Ralph Nader and Ralph Sampson play significant roles. I think there are several pages about Rear Window and college football and Mad Men and why Rivers Cuomo prefers having sex with Asian women. Supposedly there&#8217;s a chapter outlining all the things the Unabomber was right about, but perhaps I&#8217;m misinformed. Q&#58; Is there a larger theme? A&#58; Oh, something about reality. 'What is reality,' maybe? No, that&#8217;s not it. Not exactly. I get the sense that most of the core questions dwell on the way media perception constructs a fake reality that ends up becoming more meaningful than whatever actually happened. Also, Lady Gaga. Q&#58; Should I read this book? A&#58; Probably. Do you see a clear relationship between the Branch Davidian disaster and the recording of Nirvana&#8217;s In Utero? Does Barack Obama make you want to drink Pepsi? Does ABBA remind you of AC/DC? If so, you probably don&#8217;t need to read this book. You probably wrote this book. But I suspect everybody else will totally love...",
