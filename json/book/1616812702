    "description": "George and the man with the yellow hat arrive at a Halloween party&#151;but they aren&#8217;t wearing costumes. No matter&#151;there are plenty in an old trunk upstairs, and soon George is trying on all kinds of outfits. But when he wants to look in the mirror, George finds he has to jump on the bed. Downstairs, the partygoers begin to hear noises. Then the lights go out and they hear a crash! Uh-oh. Did someone say the word ghost?Hans Augusto Rey was born in Hamburg, Germany in 1898. As a child, he spent much of his free time in that city's famous Hagenbeck Zoo drawing animals. After serving in the army during World War I, he studied philology and natural science at the University of Hamburg. He then married Margret Rey and they moved to Montmartre for four years. The manuscript for the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and Curious George was published in 1941. Curious George has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian. Additional Curious George books followed, as well as such other favorites as CECILY G. AND THE NINE MONKEYS and FIND THE CONSTELLATIONS.",

    "review": "Created in the style of the original Curious George books, this story tells how Curious George inadvertently causes a sensation at his first Halloween costume party. When he and his friend arrive at Mrs. Gray's house, George learns that it is a costume party. Since he wasn't wearing one, generous Mrs. Gray lets him find a costume in her dress-up trunk. Curious George decides to be a cowboy and while jumping on the bed to see himself in the mirror, he knocks out the lights. George ends up scared and scaring the party guests, but of course all ends well and George even wins prizes for his costumes. The plot is a little complex but should appeal to fans of other Curious George books. 2001, Houghton Mifflin, $3.95. Ages 3 to 7. Reviewer&#58; Marilyn Courtot",
