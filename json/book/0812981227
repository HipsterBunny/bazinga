    "description": "You are about to travel to Edgecombe St. Mary, a small village in the English countryside filled with rolling hills, thatched cottages, and a cast of characters both hilariously original and as familiar as the members of your own family. Among them is Major Ernest Pettigrew (retired), the unlikely hero of Helen Simonson's wondrous debut. Wry, courtly, opinionated, and completely endearing, Major Pettigrew is one of the most indelible characters in contemporary fiction, and from the very first page of this remarkable novel he will steal your heart.The Major leads a quiet life valuing the proper things that Englishmen have lived by for generations&#58; honor, duty, decorum, and a properly brewed cup of tea. But then his brother's death sparks an unexpected friendship with Mrs. Jasmina Ali, the Pakistani shopkeeper from the village. Drawn together by their shared love of literature and the loss of their respective spouses, the Major and Mrs. Ali soon find their friendship blossoming into something more. But village society insists on embracing him as the quintessential local and her as the permanent foreigner. Can their relationship survive the risks one takes when pursuing happiness in the face of culture and tradition?",

    "review": "Major Ernest Pettigrew, retired, of Edgecombe St. Mary, England, is more\r\nthan a little dismayed by the sloppy manners, narcissism, and materialism\r\nof modern society. The decline of gentility is evident everywhere, from tea\r\nbags, to designer sweaters, to racism masquerading as tolerance.Mutual grief allies him with Mrs. Ali, a widowed local shopkeeper of\r\nPakistani descent who has also resigned herself to dignified, if solitary, last\r\nyears. The carefully suppressed passion between these two spawns twitters\r\nof disapproval in their provincial village, but Pettigrew hasn't time for such\r\nsilliness: real estate developers are plotting to carpet the fields outside his\r\nback door with mansionettes and his sister-in-law plans to auction off a\r\nprized family firearm. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ali's late husband's Muslim family\r\nexpects her to hand over her hard-won business to her sullen, fundamentalist\r\nnephew, a notion she finds repellant and chauvinistic.It's a testament to Simonson that in this delightful novel, Pettigrew\r\nmust navigate the tragic, the absurd, and the transcendentally joyful\r\naspects of a familiar life turned upside down by an unfamiliar and unexpected\r\nlate-life love affair. That two people from opposing and mutually\r\ndistrusting worlds are able to bridge every gap with unerring respect and\r\ndecorum serves as a quiet suggestion that larger conflicts might be avoided\r\nor resolved in much the same way. Finally, a way forward that Major\r\nPettigrew would approve.",
