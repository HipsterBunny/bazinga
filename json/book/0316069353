    "review": "Mickey Haller's legal business has been hit hard by the recession, but he's decided to turn lemons into lemonade by coming to the aid of foreclosure victims. One of his very first cases backfires, however, when soon-to-be disposed teacher Lisa Trammel emerges as the foremost suspect in a homicide case. Applying all his legal and investigatory skills, Haller turns a prosecution slam-dunk into something far more interesting. Keyed with suspense and last minute surprises, Michael Connelly's latest courtroom procedural will keep you reading and guessing to the end. Editor's recommendation.",
