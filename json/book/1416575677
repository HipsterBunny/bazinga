    "review": "New York Timesfood columnist Mark Bittman is a minimalist with an expansive vision. The author of the How to Cook Everything series doesn't believe that you need either a French Culinary Institute degree or advanced training in kitchen chemistry to satisfy the appetites of yourself and your guests. Instead, he counsels simplicity. Each of these 404 seasonal recipes is presented in just one paragraph, but the results can tempt the sternest gourmet: Shrimp with Asparagus; Dill or Spice Poached Eggs; Truffled Arugula Prosciutto Salad; Apricot Cream Upside Down Pie; Salmon and Sweet Potato with Coconut Curry Sauce. Earns a place in your kitchen cabinet.",
