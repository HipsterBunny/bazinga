    "review": "Foster follows When You Dare (May) with another fast-paced Men Who Walk the Edge of Honor romantic suspense novel featuring an antihero who goes outside the law in the name of vigilante justice. Trace Rivers, a private mercenary looking to avenge his sister's kidnapping, goes undercover as a bodyguard for Murray Coburn, human trafficker and all-around scumbag. When porn shop owner Priscilla Patterson waltzes into Murray's office and claims he's her father, Trace admires her composure and courage. As their mutual attraction grows, they confide their separate plans for Murray's demise. The fast-paced thriller keeps these well-developed characters moving, adding lots of sexy teasing as well as some comic relief in a couple of close escapes. Foster's series will continue to garner fans with this exciting installment. (June)",
