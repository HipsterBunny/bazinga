Then he makes a shocking discovery&#58; the naked, frozen body of a teenage girl, her skin as white as the snow around her. Even dead, she is the most beautiful girl he&#8217;s ever seen. It is a moment that will forever change his life and the lives of everyone around him. The mysterious dead girl&#8211;the &#8220;Virgin of Small Plains&#8221;&#8211;inspires local reverence. In the two decades following her death, strange miracles visit those who faithfully tend to her grave; some even believe that her spirit can cure deadly illnesses. Slowly, word of the legend spreads.But what really happened in that snow-covered field? Why did young Mitch Newquist disappear the day after the Virgin&#8217;s body was found, leaving behind his distraught girlfriend, Abby Reynolds? Why do the town&#8217;s three most powerful men&#8211;Dr. Quentin Reynolds, former sheriff Nathan Shellenberger, and Judge, Tom Newquist&#8211;all seem to be hiding the details of that night?Seventeen years later, when Mitch suddenly returns to Small Plains, simmering tensions come to a head, ghosts that had long slumbered whisper anew, and the secrets that some wish would stay buried rise again from the grave of the Virgin.

    "review": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewAfter more than a dozen novels, mystery and suspense author -- and longtime Kansan -- Nancy Pickard finally comes home to the Sunflower State inThe Virgin of Small Plains,a hauntingly bittersweet story about the residents of a Kansas town and the grisly secrets some of them have kept buried for 17 years.During a deadly blizzard in 1987, high school senior Rex Shellenberger and his older brother help their father search snow-covered pastures for newborn calves. What Rex finds instead is a breathtakingly beautiful young woman, completely naked and frozen to death, as if she just curled up and fallen asleep. The body is never identified and is eventually buried in an unmarked grave in the town cemetery. But even after 17 years, rumors still swirl around the girl and the mysterious events of that fateful night. How did she get there? Why did Mitch Newquist, the handsome son of the local judge, suddenly leave town -- and Abby, the love of his life -- never again to return? A growing number of people believe that visiting the unmarked grave will bring them miracles -- but there are those in the small town who know there is nothing inspirational about the legend of the Virgin of Small Plains. In fact, it's just the oppositeThe melancholic appeal of this unexpectedly touching novel can be found in the multitude of contradictions associated with small-town America. Pickard fittingly describesThe Virgin of Small Plainsas set in the place 'where Truman Capote proved inIn Cold Bloodthat small Midwestern towns can be the most deadly of all, and where Dorothy proved inThe Wizard of Ozthat there's no place like home.' Just like real life, this novel is full of joy, desire, heartbreak, tragedy -- and, above all else, hope.Paul Goat Allen",
