    "description": "Dad believed people were like money. You could be a thousand&#45;dollar person or a hundred&#45;dollar person &#45;&#45; even a ten&#45;&#44; five&#45;&#44; or one&#45;dollar person. Below that&#44; everybody was just nickels and dimes. To my dad&#44; we were pennies.Fourteen&#45;year&#45;old Manny Hernandez wants to be more than just a penny. He wants to be a vato firme&#44; the kind of guy people respect. But that&#8242;s not easy when your father is abusive&#44; your brother can&#8242;t hold a job&#44; and your mother scrubs the house as if she can wash her troubles away.In Manny&#8242;s neighborhood&#44; the way to get respect is to be in a gang. But Manny&#8242;s not sure that joining a gang is the solution. Because&#44; after all&#44; it&#8242;s his life &#45;&#45; and he wants to be the one to decide what happens to it.",

    "review": "Manny Hernandez endures a lot during the year that leads up to his initiation into a California gang. He learns about hard work out in the sweltering vegetable fields and experiences class stratification at a high school party where he is not welcomed. Manny helps his older sister through a life-threatening miscarriage but almost takes his younger brother's life when he accidentally fires his father's shotgun. The young protagonist narrates all of these events with a future writer's eye for detail and a unique take on human character. Martinez's coming-of-age story reads like true adolescence - absurd and funny from a distance, yet painful when you're stuck in the middle of it all. I already lost one afternoon to this bitter-sweet book and now I've picked it up again. I think many reluctant readers would also have a hard time turning away once Manny started talking straight to them about what growing up is really all about.",
