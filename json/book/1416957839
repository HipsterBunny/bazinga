But Ruby is in over her head, and finds she is risking more and more when she&rsquo;s with him.In an effort to keep Ruby occupied, Ruby&rsquo;s mother, Ann, drags Ruby to the weekly book club she runs. When it is discovered that one of the group&rsquo;s own members is the subject of the tragic love story they are reading, Ann and Ruby spearhead a reunion between the long-ago lovers. But for Ruby, this mission turns out to be much more than just a road trip. . . .",
