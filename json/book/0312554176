    "review": "Nick Russo is a pediatric plastic surgeon whose work often takes him away from his home and his own two children, but in an absorbing new case, it also threatens to destroy his marriage. The doctor's devotion to six-year-old burn victim Charlie Anderson develops into an extramarital affair with his single mom, Valerie, an attorney. Meanwhile, Russo's stay-at-home wife, Tessa, is leading what appears to be a charmed suburban life. And then, an accident jolts these two women together in an unforeseeable way. An enthralling character study by the author of Love the One You're With and Something Blue. (Hand-selling tip&#58; Heart of the Matter is rendered artfully through the alternating voices of the two main female characters.)",
