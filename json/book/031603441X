    "review": "The publisher's bio of the author reads, 'Keith Richards was born in England in 1943 and founded the Rolling Stones with Mick Jagger in 1962. He lives in Connecticut.' In the tersely-titled Life, Keith himself fills in all the tantalizing gaps in that pr&eacute;cis. That this long-discussed autobiography has been wildly anticipated should surprise no serious rock watcher&#58; Over the decades, Richards' life, lifestyle, and relationships with other band members have spawned proliferating rumors. The archetypal exile on Main Street finally speaks his mind. Sometimes you can get what you want. A Barnes & Noble Bestseller now in a paperback and NOOKbook.",
