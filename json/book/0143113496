    "review": "Barnes & Noble Discover Great New WritersA 12-year-old girl is found murdered at an archaeological site at the center of a controversial highway construction project.  Katy Devlin was a popular girl who had recently been accepted to the Royal Ballet School; her father is an outspoken opponent of the new roadway.  But what haunts Detective Rob Ryan about this case is its location: the quiet town of Knocknaree, Ireland -- in the very woods where he used to play as a child.Twenty years ago, a young Rob and his two best friends went into the woods, chasing each other, playing in a castle of ruins.  But they didn't return to their homes at sunset. A search party was dispatched to canvas the woods, finding only a catatonic Rob clawing at a tree, his clothing ripped, his shoes filled with blood.Detective Ryan has always guarded this secret of his past, but the recent murder forces him to reveal it to his new partner, drawing them closer together in the search for the perpetrator.  Is there a connection between Rob's childhood trauma and Katy Devlin's murder?  And is Detective Ryan prepared to confront the secrets that lie deep in those woods?  Suspects abound in this fast-paced mystery -- a stunning debut that examines the complexities of the human mind and the cost of discovering the truth.       \r\n(Fall 2007 Selection)",
