    "description": "Winner of the 2010 National Book Critics Circle Award for NonfictionWinner of 2011 Mark Lynton History PrizeOne of The New York Times Book Review&rsquo;s 10 Best Books of 2010In this epic, beautifully written masterwork, Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winning author Isabel Wilkerson chronicles one of the great untold stories of American history&#58; the decades-long migration of black citizens who fled the South for northern and western cities, in search of a better life. From 1915 to 1970, this exodus of almost six million people changed the face of America. Wilkerson compares this epic migration to the migrations of other peoples in history. She interviewed more than a thousand people, and gained access to new data and official records, to write this definitive and vividly dramatic account of how these American journeys unfolded, altering our cities, our country, and ourselves.&#160;With stunning historical detail, Wilkerson tells this story through the lives of three unique individuals&#58; Ida Mae Gladney, who in 1937 left sharecropping and prejudice in Mississippi for Chicago, where she achieved quiet blue-collar success and, in old age, voted for Barack Obama when he ran for an Illinois Senate seat; sharp and quick-tempered George Starling, who in 1945 fled Florida for Harlem, where he endangered his job fighting for civil rights, saw his family fall, and finally found peace in God; and Robert Foster, who left Louisiana in 1953 to pursue a medical career,...",

    "review": "&#8230;a landmark piece of nonfiction&#8230;[Wilkerson] works on a grand, panoramic scale but also on a very intimate one, since this work of living history boils down to the tenderly told stories of three rural Southerners who immigrated to big cities from their hometowns. She winds up with a mesmerizing book that warrants comparison toThe Promised Land,Nicholas Lemann's study of the Great Migration's early phase, andCommon Ground,J. Anthony Lukas's great, close-range look at racial strife in Boston.",
