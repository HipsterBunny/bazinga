    "description": "An incredible publishing story&#151;written over the course of thirty years by a highly decorated Vietnam veteran, a New York Times best seller for sixteen weeks, a National Indie Next and a USA Today best seller&#151;Matterhorn has been hailed as a &#147;brilliant account of war&#8221; (New York Times Book Review). Now out in paperback, Matterhorn is an epic war novel in the tradition of Norman Mailer&#8217;s The Naked and the Dead and James Jones&#8217;s The Thin Red Line. It is the timeless story of a young Marine lieutenant, Waino Mellas, and his comrades in Bravo Company, who are dropped into the mountain jungle of Vietnam as boys and forced to fight their way into manhood. Standing in their way are not merely the North Vietnamese but also monsoon rain and mud, leeches and tigers, disease and malnutrition. Almost as daunting, it turns out, are the obstacles they discover between each other&#58; racial tension, competing ambitions, and duplicitous superior officers. But when the company finds itself surrounded and outnumbered by a massive enemy regiment, the Marines are thrust into the raw and all-consuming terror of combat. The experience will change them forever.Matterhorn is a visceral and spellbinding novel about what it is like to be a young man at war. It is an unforgettable novel that transforms the tragedy of Vietnam into a powerful and universal story of courage, camaraderie, and sacrifice&#58; a parable...",

    "review": "From his earliest days on the ground, Lieutenant Waino Mellas &#151;\r\nPrinceton educated, fresh, green, and uneasy in his new fatigues &#151; has\r\nsecond-guessed his decision to become a marine. Yet here he is, an officer\r\nleading a rifle platoon in a desolate corner of South Vietnam. The men in\r\nMarlantes's gut-wrenching first novel &#151; young, raw, and far from home\r\n&#151; are facing the toughest trial by fire imaginable. Dumped on a jungle\r\nhilltop that's shrouded in monsoon rains and clouds, they're too crippled\r\nby fatigue, boredom, and the dearth of supplies to question policy. Like\r\nmost soldiers, they follow orders whether they make sense or not, in a\r\nwar too complex for them to figure out.Authentic and unflinching, with dialogue so vivid it plunges readers\r\nsquarely into the inferno of war,Matterhornis both white-knuckled\r\nadventure and superb literature. From the smallest details &#151; the music,\r\nthe gear, and the C rations; the smells, the heat, and the humidity &#151; to\r\nthe most profound judgments made high up the chain of command, it's a\r\ntour de force of storytelling. A celebration of the courage and camaraderie\r\nof our young men in uniform, and a chilling indictment of the politics of\r\nwar,Matterhornis an unforgettable and vital testament that keeps alive\r\nthe thousands of stories of heroism during what some might consider one\r\nof history's darkest and most regrettable moments.",
