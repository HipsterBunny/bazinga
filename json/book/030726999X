    "review": "This novel not only puts the cap on the most eagerly read trilogy in years; the sequel to The Girl Who Played With Fire marks the completion of its Swedish author's career&#58; Stieg Larsson died at the age of fifty in 2004. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is, however, too exciting and too adept to be read simply as a major author's memorial. From its onset, with 'avenging angel' protagonist Lisbeth Salander lying in intensive care, this fiction pulses forward. One British critic called it 'intricately plotted, lavishly detailed but written with a breakneck pace and verve...a tantalizing double finale&#151;first idyllic, then frenetic.'",
