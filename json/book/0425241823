    "review": "The paranormal outweighs the romance in Navajo Stormwalker Janet Bengay's exciting third adventure (after 2010's Stormwalker and Firewalker). Janet, her motorcycle, and the local sheriff and his vehicle drop into a sinkhole filled with magical petroglyphs. She emerges from the accident to discover her hotel has been targeted by the Hopi County safety inspector; half-Apache, half-hell goddess Gabrielle is seeking Janet's power; and a Shadow Walker is after Janet and her dragon Firewalker boyfriend, Mick Burns. Mick is touched by evil magic, enslaved to a witch, and Janet is concerned there may be no way to free him without killing him. The life-and-death tension and steamy sex scenes are nicely drawn, and fans of both paranormal romance and urban fantasy will enjoy James's intoxicating blend of the two. (June)",
