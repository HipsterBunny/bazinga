    "description": "The first entry in a multivolume set that will be essential reading for aspiring producers and artists everywhere, Q on Producing presents the master's approach to making music. Told to and compiled by author and audio expert Bill Gibson, Quincy's observations, culled from over a year of in-depth interviews, are collected and presented in book form and on an accompanying DVD-ROM, providing an unparalleled course of instruction from one of the true legends of American music. Reaching back to his early successes, Quincy discusses the techniques learned as an arranger for such legendary performers as Count Basie and Ray Charles, as a touring bandleader, and as a young producer with his first pop successes. Coauthor Gibson, in chapters such as 'Discovering Talent,' 'The Producer/Engineer Relationship,' and 'Tools for Success,' outlines the many skills Quincy developed and broadened as he graduated to film and TV work, his solo recordings, and his game-changing albums with Michael Jackson, as well as more recent productions. With invaluable advice on subjects such as songwriting, scoring, and the modern music business - to be expanded on in subsequent volumes - Q on Producing provides the foundation for what is sure to be the most anticipated series of tutorials on music production ever created.",

    "review": "The first in a planned multivolume set, this title is more of a tribute to Jones and his career than a vehicle for practical advice. The stories are certainly remarkable considering Jones's lengthy and diverse career, but they are often presented in a stream-of-consciousness way that may detract from the reading experience. The main problem is simply that the content doesn't match the stated intent; this is a blend of anecdotal stories by Jones and laudatory essays by fellow artists (even a recipe for Thriller Ribs is thrown in for good measure), but it's not 'essential reading for aspiring producers and musicians everywhere,' as the publisher claims. Jones mentions working with filmmaker Sidney Lumet&mdash;scoring such films as The Pawnbroker and The Wiz&mdash;and one hopes future volumes in this series will address the details and specifics of Jones's production style, which could result in a work as important to his craft as Lumet's Making Movies is for filmmaking. (The accompanying DVD, exploring production techniques in the studio, was not seen.) Verdict A conversational and informative look at Jones's career, but not necessary for most library collections.&mdash;Peter Thornell, Hingham P.L., MA",
