Book One of the Wheel of Time isThe Eye of the World,a staggeringly complex and enjoyable adventure that's not without its own cast of unforgettable characters: Rand, a simple sheepherder who is stalked by an evil he does not yet understand; Egwene, Rand's love interest, who happens to possess her own very special gift; Moraine, the beautiful but possibly dangerous member of a powerful legion of sorceresses called Aes Sedai; and Lan, Moraine's fearless companion and guardian.--Andrew LeCount",
