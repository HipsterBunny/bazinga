    "review": "A new front and a decisive campaign opens in Jeff Shaara's stunning World War II epic. With his European and North African trilogy finished, this consummate storyteller moves on to the fierce battles of the Pacific theater. As in No Less Than Victory and other previous novels, Shaara presents the war through the experiences of diverse combatants; in this case including a young Marine, President Harry S. Truman, Admiral Chester Nimitz, a U.S. ground commander, an A-bomb pilot, a Hiroshima physician, and a Japanese general. The Final Storm possesses the immediacy and intensity of close combat.",
