    "review": "Stone Barrington's latest client is no stranger. Arrington Calder isn't just a former lover, this one-time heartthrob is the mother of Stone's son. Arrington, it seems, has been recently widowed by her actor husband, leaving her as the custodian of a fortune in Hollywood studio stock. Intent on cashing in, his pretty ex asks Stone to handle the dull paperwork involved in the deal. There is nothing dull, however, about what Barrington encounters when he arrives on the Bel-Air scene. A sexy action thriller from the author of Strategic Moves and Lucid Intervals.",
