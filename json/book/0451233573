    "review": "When Baltimore medical examiner Lucy Trask finds herself at the center of a dizzying swirl of murders in Rose's turn-off-your-cellphone-settle-in-for-the-night page-turner, Trask turns to super-hunk Det. J.D. Fitzpatrick for counsel and protection. The only problem is that in order to get his help&mdash;and solve the murders&mdash;the reticent ME has to let loose some of her most private secrets. It doesn't matter that Fitzpatrick revs her engine anytime he's near. The good doctor has deep-seated trust issues, some that go back to the incident that may have inspired the current spate of mutilation murders committed by a demonic sadist who won't let go. But as bodies pile up in Trask's morgue, secrets are exposed in more ways than one. Rose (Silent Scream) doesn't allow her luxurious characterizations to get in the way of a wicked good plot that grabs hold and maintains tension from beginning to end. (June)",
