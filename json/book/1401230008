    "review": "Bill Willingham's Fables has delighted readers and probably infuriated a few purists by reshuffling the elements of genres from fables, myths, and fairy tales to spy stories, whodunits, to zany romantic comedies. In his latest illustrated epic, Snow White's sister Rose Red returns to center-stage to grapple with demons both personal and public. (P.S. Mark Buckingham's striking pictures perfectly capture the tone of Willingham's tale.)",
