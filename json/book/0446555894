    "description": "Modeled after Maria Shriver'sJust Who Will You Be, Queen Latifah's goal withPut On Your Crownis to help young women build a strong sense of self-esteem. A US Dept. of Justice survey found that females ages 16-24 are more vulnerable to partner violence than any other group, almost triple the national average. Cases like Chris Brown's assault on pop star Rihanna showed an ugly side of adolescent life. However, Queen Latifah has always been a shining example of a woman happy with herself and unwilling to compromise to fit into the 'hollywood ideal' of what a confident beautiful woman should look like. The result&#58; She's one of the biggest A-list celebrities in Hollywood.",

    "review": "Rapper, singer, actress, author Queen Latifah is one of the most recognizable and beloved women on the planet. In each of her specialties, she shows her millions of fans what an energetic small-town girl from Jersey can do even when the odds are against her. Like her 1999 autobiography, Ladies First, this mentoring guide draws on the experiences of herself and her friends to lay its life lessons. Put on Your Crown focuses on issues such as partner violence and sexual abuse that pervade our society. A personal lesson in self-empowerment. (Hand-selling tip&#58; Like any other book by Queen Latifah, this book has strong crossover appeal.)",
