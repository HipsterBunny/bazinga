        "description": "Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime?These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit,...",

        "review": "Alternating among the perspectives of three girls at an urban high school, Williams-Garcia (Like Sisters on the Homefront) shows once again her uncanny ability to project unique voices. Benched by the basketball coach for her low grades, Dominique is trying to bite back her rage when 'some stupid little flit comes skipping down B corridor like the Easter Bunny.... Skipping. In all that pink' and walks between Dominique and her 'girls,' 'like she don't see I'm here and all the space around me is mines.' That's it-Dominique vows to 'kick her ass' at exactly 2:45. Her intended victim, Trina-already full of herself over her looks, and pumped up because she's about to hang her latest masterpiece of art in a hallway)-does not hear, but Leticia does, and she can't wait to tell her best friend ('That would be something to see.... Trina getting stomped on school grounds'). And when Leticia's friend argues that Leticia ought to warn Trina, the plot quickens rather than taking a simple path around should-she/shouldn't-she. So well observed that the characters seem to leap off the page, the novel leaves a strong and lingering impact.

Was there really an Eleanor Rigby? Where's Penny Lane? In A Hard Day's Write,  music journalist Steve Turner shatters many well-worn myths and adds a new dimension to the Fab Four's rich legacy by investigating for the first time the ordinary people and events immortalized in the Beatles' music and now occupying a special niche in popular culture's collective imagination.Arranged chronologically by album, the book breaks new ground by exploring how private incidents influenced the group's writing and how their music evolved. Turner reveals that Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was really a drawing by Julian Lennon of his childhood friend; Bungalow Bill was an all-American tiger hunter; Doctor Robert was a New York 'speech doctor'; and much more. A longtime Beatles admirer, Turner tracked down and interviewed the real-life subjects of the songs, probed public records and newspaper archives, and spoke in depth to the people closet to the Beatles to unearth tales that have never before been made public. The result is a book that chronicles an untold story of the Beatles themselves.Illustrated with over 200 photographs, A Hard Day's Write is a visually alluring and highly entertaining journey to the land stretching just beneath your conscious mind, mapped out with strawberry fields, fool-topped hills,...",

        "description": "Winner of the 2010 National Book Award for NonfictionIt was the summer Coltrane died, the summer of love and riots, and the summer when a chance encounter in Brooklyn led two young people on a path of art, devotion, and initiation.Patti Smith would evolve as a poet and performer, and Robert Mapplethorpe would direct his highly provocative style toward photography. Bound in innocence and enthusiasm, they traversed the city from Coney Island to Forty-second Street, and eventually to the celebrated round table of Max's Kansas City, where the Andy Warhol contingent held court. In 1969, the pair set up camp at the Hotel Chelsea and soon entered a community of the famous and infamous&#151;the influential artists of the day and the colorful fringe. It was a time of heightened awareness, when the worlds of poetry, rock and roll, art, and sexual politics were colliding and exploding. In this milieu, two kids made a pact to take care of each other. Scrappy, romantic, committed to create, and fueled by their mutual dreams and drives, they would prod and provide for one another during the hungry years.Just Kidsbegins as a love story and ends as an elegy. It serves as a salute to New York City during the late sixties and seventies and to its rich and poor, its hustlers and hellions. A true fable, it is a portrait of two young artists' ascent, a prelude to fame.",

In this raw, tender memoir, she retrieves prose snapshots of her relationship with 'the artist of my life,' Robert Mapplethorpe. In the late sixties, when the two became lovers, roommates, and fellow pranksters, neither was famous. With fondness and a keen sense of observation, Smith recalls their overlapping lives and lifelong mutual affection.

Second only to the Beatles in sales for years, Led Zeppelin was rock's premier group. But unlike the boys from Liverpool, the excitement of this band's music was matched by the fever pitch of their antics on and off the stage....In hotel rooms and stadiums, in a customized private Boeing 707 jet and country estates, Richard Cole saw it all &#151; and here he tells it all in this close-up, down-and-dirty, no-holds-barred account that records the highs, the lows, and the occasional in-betweens.

They fell in love. They took their honeymoon on bicycles. They expanded the periodic table, discovering two new elements with startling properties, radium and polonium. They recognized radioactivity as an atomic property, heralding the dawn of a new scientific era. They won the Nobel Prize. Newspapers mythologized the couple's romance, beginning articles on the Curies with 'Once upon a time . . . ' Then, in 1906, Pierre was killed in a freak accident. Marie continued their work alone. She won a second Nobel Prize in 1911, and fell in love again, this time with the married physicist Paul Langevin. Scandal ensued. Duels were fought.In the century since the Curies began their work, we've struggled with nuclear weapons proliferation, debated the role of radiation in medical treatment, and pondered nuclear energy as a solution to climate change. In Radioactive, Lauren Redniss links these contentious questions to a love story in 19th Century Paris.Radioactive draws on Redniss's original reporting in Asia, Europe and the United States, her interviews with scientists, engineers, weapons specialists, atomic bomb survivors, and Marie and Pierre Curie's own granddaughter.Whether young or old, scientific novice or expert, no one will fail to be moved by Lauren Redniss's...",

How the States Got Their Shapes is the first book to tackle why our state lines are where they are. Here are the stories behind the stories, right down to the tiny northward jog at the eastern end of Tennessee and the teeny-tiny (and little known) parts of Delaware that are not attached to Delaware but to New Jersey.

        "review": "America's first century was defined by expansion and the negotiation of territories among areas colonized by the French and Spanish, or occupied by natives. The exact location of borders became paramount; playwright and screenwriter Stein amasses the story of each state's border, channeling them into a cohesive whole. Proceeding through the states alphabetically, Stein takes the innovative step of addressing each border-north, south, east, west-separately. Border stories shine a spotlight on many aspects of American history: the 49th parallel was chosen for the northern borders of Minnesota, North Dakota, and Montana because they ensured England's access to the Great Lakes, vital to their fur trade; in 1846, Washington D.C. residents south of the Potomac successfully petitioned to rejoin Virginia (called both 'retrocession' and 'a crime') in order to keep out free African-Americans. Aside from tales of violent conquest and political glad-handing, there's early, breathtaking tales of American politicos' favorite sport, gerrymandering (in 1864, Idaho judge Sidney Edgerton single-handedly 'derailed' Idaho's proposed boundary, to Montana's benefit, with $2,000 in gold). American history enthusiasts should be captivated by this fun, informative text.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Through Denny, Enzo has gained tremendous insight into the human condition, and he sees that life, like racing, isn't simply about going fast. Using the techniques needed on the race track, one can successfully navigate all of life's ordeals. On the eve of his death, Enzo takes stock of his life, recalling all that he and his family have been through: the sacrifices Denny has made to succeed professionally; the unexpected loss of Eve, Denny's wife; the three-year battle over their daughter, Zo\u00eb, whose maternal grandparents pulled every string to gain custody. In the end, despite what he sees as his own limitations, Enzo comes through heroically to preserve the Swift family, holding in his heart the dream that Denny will become a racing champion with Zo\u00eb at his side. Having learned what it takes to be a compassionate and successful person, the wise canine can barely wait until his next lifetime, when he is sure he will return as a man. A heart-wrenching but deeply funny and ultimately uplifting story of family, love, loyalty, and hope, The Art of Racing in the Rain is a beautifully crafted and captivating look at the wonders and absurdities of human life...",

        "description": "In picturesque Rosewood, Pennsylvania, neighbors gossip over picket fences, and gleaming SUVs sit in every crushed-granite driveway. But recently, friendly smiles have been replaced with suspicious glares and accusatory whispers and it's all because Hanna, Aria, Emily, and Spencer just can't keep their mouths shut. . . .First they claimed they found a dead body in the woods behind Spencer's house, only to have it vanish without a trace. Then when the same woods went up in flames, they swore they saw someone who's supposed to be dead rise from the ashes. And even after all that, the pretty little liars are still playing with fire.Hanna's trading in her Dior trench for a straitjacket. Aria's trying to contact the dead. Emily's dumped her boyfriend and is skipping town . . . again. And Spencer thinks someone in her family has gotten away with murder.The friends insist they're telling the truth about what they saw, but all of Rosewood thinks they're simply out for attention and nobody likes a girl who cries wolf. So when the big bad killer comes after the girls, will anyone believe them . . . or will they be the next to disappear?",

        "review": "Heartless is book seven in the Pretty Little Liars (PLL) series, which is now being made into a television series on the ABC Family network. PLL is the story of four friends - Emily, Aria, Hanna and Spencer - who are dealing with the disappearance and death of Alison DiLaurentis. Each of the girls has secrets they want to keep, including the fact that someone named 'A' keeps texting them and threatening to tell all. In Heartless, the four girls awaken at Spencer's house after a fire has been set. The girls insist that they have seen Ali alive. Emily is sent on a mission to Amish country where she learns that a girl named Leah was also killed, possibly by the police officer investigating them for Alison's death. The girls seek the help of a medium while Hanna is sent to a clinic to deal with her eating disorder; here, another possible suspect is identified. Ultimately, all four girls end up arrested and in jail for Ali's murder, only to realize that 'A' has been trying to turn them against each other. When another girl is murdered, a new suspect emerges and the girls are released from jail&#151;still unsure of the identity of the text-messaging 'A'. Pretty Little Liars is Desperate Housewives for teens, with a little Queen Bees and Wannabees thrown in. There are a lot of characters and twists and turns to keep track of, but the mystery is interesting and will keep teens invested. Fans of the series will want to read this newest title; but new readers should start with book one. Reviewer: Karen Jensen",

        "review": "Journalist Darlington affectionately chronicles the largely untold story of the wine rush of the 1970s&mdash;a time when sales of wine eclipsed that of beer and when a number of vineyards and wineries began in California. Focusing his attention on two sides of the industry, Darlington traces the wildly different tales of two men, both committed to producing the perfect wine. Leo McCloskey founded Enologix to help wineries produce a successful commercial product; vineyards send grapes to Enologix and through chemical analysis, the company advises its customers on the quality of the grapes and on the quality of the wines that such grapes might produce. For winemaker Randall Grahm, the vineyard represents his spiritual path, perhaps the only way he has of bringing balance to his life and achieving something like contentment. Darlington's fast-paced story of the quest for the ideal wine charmingly explores the parallel paths of two men&#58; one a modern Mephistopheles promising clients a deal by which they could acquire hidden knowledge and earthly success (McCloskey) and the other a modern-day Faust consumed by a sweeping and sometimes self-defeating desire for cosmic insight (Grahm).

Born in Yonkers as Stephen Victor Tallarico, this son of a classical musician and pianist really began to blossom after he and his fledgling band moved to Boston in 1970. For decades thereafter, Tyler full-out performances onstage and off have captured fans' imaginations. Clearly, he meant it when he famously asserted, 'If it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing.'

She's good with animals&mdash;her mother found her playing fetch with a cougar when she was five&mdash;but the big cats are hanging around more than usual.

And newly arrived bad boy Rafe suddenly starts sharing his secret past, a past sure to cause trouble for Maya.

Rebekkah Barrow never forgot the attention her grandmother Maylene bestowed upon the dead of Claysville, the small town where Bek spent her adolescence. There wasn't a funeral that Maylene didn't attend, and at each one Rebekkah watched as Maylene performed the same unusual ritual&#58; She took three sips from a silver flask and spoke the words 'Sleep well, and stay where I put you.' Now Maylene is dead, and Bek must go back to the place she left a decade earlier. She soon discovers that Claysville is not just the sleepy town she remembers, and that Maylene had good reason for her odd traditions. It turns out that in Claysville the worlds of the living and the dead are dangerously connected; beneath the town lies a shadowy, lawless land ruled by the enigmatic Charles, aka Mr. D. If the dead are not properly cared for, they will come back to satiate themselves with food, drink, and stories from the land of the living. Only the Graveminder, by tradition a Barrow woman, and her Undertaker&#151;in this case Byron Montgomery, with whom Bek shares a complicated past&#151;can set things right once the dead begin to walk. Although she is still grieving for Maylene, Rebekkah will soon find that she has more than a funeral to attend to in Claysville, and that what awaits her may be far worse&#58; dark secrets, a centuries-old bargain, a romance that still haunts her, and a frightening new responsibility&#151;to stop a monster and put...",

Though her childhood is one of brutality and fear, Tete finds solace in the traditional rhythms of African drums and in the voodoo loas she discovers through her fellow slaves.When twenty-year-old Toulouse Valmorain arrives on the island in 1770, it's with powdered wigs in his baggage and dreams of financial success in his mind. But running his father's plantation, Saint Lazare, is neither glamorous nor easy. It will be eight years before he brings home a bride&#151;but marriage, too, proves more difficult than he imagined. And Valmorain remains dependent on the services of his teenaged slave.Spanning four decades,Island Beneath the Seais the moving story of the intertwined lives of Tete and Valmorain, and of one woman's determination to find love amid loss, to offer humanity though her own has been battered, and to forge her own identity in the cruellest of circumstances.",

        "review": "[Signature]Reviewed by Marlon JamesOf the many pitfalls lurking for the historical novel, the most dangerous is history itself. The best writers either warp it for selfish purposes (Gore Vidal), dig for the untold, interior history (Toni Morrison), or both (Jeannette Winterson). Allende, four years after Ines of My Soul, returns with another historical novel, one that soaks up so much past life that there is nowhere left to go but where countless have been. Opening in Saint Domingue a few years before the Haitian revolution would tear it apart, the story has at its center Zarit&eacute;, a mulatto whose extraordinary life takes her from that blood-soaked island to dangerous and freewheeling New Orleans; from rural slave life to urban Creole life and a different kind of cruelty and adventure. Yet even in the new city, Zarit&eacute; can't quite free herself from the island, and the people alive and dead that have followed her.Zarit&eacute;'s passages are striking. More than merely lyrical, they map around rhythms and spirits, making her as much conduit as storyteller. One wishes there was more of her because, unlike Allende, Zarit&eacute; is under no mission to show us how much she knows. Every instance, a brush with a faith healer, for example, is an opportunity for Allende to showcase what she has learned about voodoo, medicine, European and Caribbean history, Napoleon, the Jamaican slave Boukman, and the legendary Mackandal, a runaway slave and master of black magic who has appeared in several novels including Alejo Carpentier's Kingdom of This World. The effect of such display of research is a novel that is as inert as a history textbook, much like, oddly enough John Updike's Terrorist, a novel that revealed an author who studied a voluminous amount of facts without learning a single truth.Slavery as a subject in fiction is still a high-wire act, but one expects more from Allende. Too often she forgoes the restraint and empathy essential for such a topic and plunges into a heavy breathing prose reminiscent of the Falconhurst novels of the 1970s, but without the guilty pleasure of sexual taboo. Sex, overwritten and undercooked, is where &ldquo;opulent hips slithered like a knowing snake until she impaled herself upon his rock-hard member with a deep sigh of joy.&rdquo; Even the references to African spirituality seem skin-deep and perfunctory, revealing yet another writer too entranced by the myth of black cultural primitivism to see the brainpower behind it. With Ines of My Soul one had the sense that the author was trying to structure a story around facts, dates, incidents, and real people. Here it is the reverse, resulting in a book one second-guesses at every turn. Of course there will be a forbidden love. Betrayal. Incest. Heartbreak. Insanity. Violence. And in the end the island in the novel's title remains legend. Fittingly so, because to reach the Island Beneath the Sea, one would have had to dive deep. Allende barely skims the surface.Marlon James's recent novel, The Book of Night Women was a finalist for the 2010 National Book Critics Circle Award.",

Patrick McLanahan now retired to Battle Mountain, Nev. There McLanahan continues his lifetime of service by flying rescue missions for the local Civil Air Patrol. In an earlier installment, America survived an attack by Russian bombers after McLanahan led a successful counterattack, but now the economic crash of 2012 has achieved what the Russians were unable to accomplish. Severe budget cuts have mothballed much of America's armed might, and now homegrown terrorists known as the Knights of the True Republic of America are carrying out attacks on the government. McLanahan has a full plate of domestic difficulties&mdash;his 17-year-old son, Brad, is chafing at the familial bonds, and McLanahan's girlfriend, Gia, has disappeared. Fortunately, McLanahan can rely on the help of his fellow CAP volunteers and some old friends in his battle with the terrorists. Established fans will have no trouble following the action, but newcomers are advised to dive into the series two or three books back if they really want to know what's going on. (May)",

From breaking into the industry with the band Montrose to his multiplatinum solo career to his ride as the front man of Van Halen, Sammy's powerful and unforgettable voice has set the tone for some of the greatest rock anthems ever written&#151;songs like 'I Can't Drive 55,' 'Right Now,' and 'Why Can't This Be Love.' In Red, Sammy tells the outrageous story of his tear through rock 'n' roll, detailing the backstage antics and nonstop touring that have made his voice instantly recognizable. Beginning with his musical coming-of-age in the blue-collar towns of California, Sammy traces his rough and determined rise to fame, working harder than anyone else out there and writing songs about the things he loved&#151;fast cars, loud parties, and lots of good times. But solo success was just the start, a prelude to his raucous and notorious decade as the front man for Van Halen, one of the biggest-selling rock groups in history. Filled with behind-the-scenes stories from his time with the band, Red offers the Van Halen story as Sammy saw it, holding nothing back about the worldwide stadium tours, the tensions with Eddie, the messy parties, the divided friendships, and, of course, his controversial and widely disputed exit from the band. After Van Halen, Sammy changed directions...",

He learns about hard work out in the sweltering vegetable fields and experiences class stratification at a high school party where he is not welcomed. Manny helps his older sister through a life-threatening miscarriage but almost takes his younger brother's life when he accidentally fires his father's shotgun. The young protagonist narrates all of these events with a future writer's eye for detail and a unique take on human character. Martinez's coming-of-age story reads like true adolescence - absurd and funny from a distance, yet painful when you're stuck in the middle of it all. I already lost one afternoon to this bitter-sweet book and now I've picked it up again. I think many reluctant readers would also have a hard time turning away once Manny started talking straight to them about what growing up is really all about.",

He has earned the cooperation of Fidel Castro over cigars and the admiration of Rupert Murdoch, who said of Rhodes, 'By dogged hard work, Bill forms important and great relationships. Everyone knows Bill. Everyone trusts Bill.'From these and other experiences, Rhodes has learned a lifetime of lessons about managing amid crises&#151;and, more important, how to lead prudently, decisively, and effectively to prevent crises from ever happening in the first place. In Banker to the World, Rhodes presents his collected wisdom, best-practices, analysis, and anecdotes in one essential volume on the creation of value through leadership&#151;and on the importance of leading by one's values.Dramatically illustrated by more than two dozen examples, Rhodes's principles offer an excellent foundation for leaders at all levels.

Debut novelist and NPR commentator Green perfectly captures the intensity of feeling and despair that defines adolescence in this hip, shocking, and emotionally charged work of fiction.Miles has a quirky interest in famous people's last words, especially Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais's final statement, 'I go to seek a Great Perhaps.'  Determined not to wait for death to begin a similar quest, Miles convinces his parents to let him leave home.  Once settled at Culver Creek Preparatory School, he befriends a couple of equally gifted outcasts: his roommate Chip -- commonly known as the Colonel -- who has a predilection for memorizing long, alphabetical lists for fun; and the beautiful and unpredictable Alaska, whom Miles comes to adore.The kids grow closer as they make their way through a school year filled with contraband, tests, pranks, breakups, and revelations about family and life.  But as the story hurtles toward its shattering climax, chapter headings like 'forty-six days before' and 'the last day' portend a tragic event -- one that will change Miles forever and lead him to new conclusions about the value of his cherished 'Great Perhaps.'\r\n(Summer 2005 Selection)",

        "description": "The Outsiders is a book that delves deeply into the hearts, minds, and stories of a group that had no voice before S. E. Hinton gave them one.  She began writing the book at age 15, spurred on by the disturbing trend she saw growing in her high school towards division between groups.  'I was worried and angered by the social situation,' Hinton writes. 'I saw two groups at the extreme ends of the social scale behaving in an idiotic fashion -- one group was being condemned and one wasn't.... When a friend of mine was beaten up for no other reason than that some people didn't like the way he combed his hair, I took my anger out by writing about it.'Thirty years after it was first published, The Outsiders still carries the same frightening and unifying messages for teens (and readers of all ages).  The ruthlessly realistic and violent story of the Greasers and the Socs, rival gangs from very different sides of the railroad tracks, is narrated by Ponyboy Curtis, a smart, sensitive kid who has grown to become one of the most recognizable figures in the history of young adult literature.  Any teen who has ever felt isolated or different can identify with Ponyboy, a kid forced to be tough on the outside, but who underneath is just as scared and needy as anyone.  Hinton herself has said that she has never written a character as close to her own self as Ponyboy is.  Young Adult fiction was shaped and defined by Susan Eloise Hinton, and the realism she attached to...",

        "review": "Though Marisa struggles with an anxiety disorder and depression, she starts the school year wanting 'everyone at school to know I am not a freak anymore.' Her life becomes more exciting when Derek, the popular boy she has a crush on, asks her out. But when Marisa begins suspecting Derek's relationship with his ex, her obsessive negative thinking returns. Colasanti (Take Me There) expertly handles the plot, keeping it ambiguous whether Derek is cheating on Marisa, or if he is being honest when he tells her, 'You're accusing me of something I didn't do.' The author also nicely contrasts Marisa's exciting but shallow relationship with Derek with her much deeper connection to nerdy Nash, to whom she opens up about her problems. There is no doubt who Marisa will eventually be with (and readers will easily ID the mysterious Dirty Dirk, a DJ who provides advice and hope to students via podcasts). Colasanti presents an authentic picture of how complicated it is to be a teenager, especially one in love. Ages 12-up.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Printz Award for excellence in literature for young adults, writer An Na tells the story of a Korean family that immigrates to California in search of a better life, only to find that the American Dream is harder to achieve than they thought. Told through the eyes of Young Ju, who is a preschooler when the book begins and a young woman heading off to college by the time it ends,A Step from Heavenis a moving and sometimes painful tale about cultural differences, family dynamics, and the struggle to survive.As little Young Ju's plane leaves Korea and climbs high into the sky, she thinks she is headed for heaven. In a way, so do her parents, who believe that America will offer them big opportunities and a more heavenly lifestyle. But life is much harder than they anticipate, and both of Young Ju's parents must work multiple jobs just to make ends meet while they share a house with relatives. Disillusioned and ashamed, Young Ju's father tries to drown the harsh realities of his life in liquor, eventually descending into a pit of alcoholism that turns him emotionally and physically abusive.Though the family as a unit doesn't adapt well, Young Ju adjusts quickly and soon excels in school. But the shame of her family's poverty and her father's worsening alcoholism leads to several lies and cover-ups that prevent her from ever fully embracing her new life. Caught between two cultures and increasingly isolated by the growing tension within her family, Young Ju eventually finds herself at a crossroads, forced to make a decision that will likely tear her family apart.A Step from Heavenis an insightful, enriching read that should appeal to teens and young adults on many levels. An Na tells the story through a series of vignettes, using poetic prose and well-drawn characters. And Young Ju's wonderfully engaging voice is a perfect match for the family's evolving reality, ranging from the starry-eyed wonder she has as a toddler to the quiet but hopeful reflectiveness she expresses as a young adult.(Beth Amos)",

High school graduate Remy has some biting commentary about love,  including her romance-writer mother's betrothal to a car dealer  ('He put one hand on my shoulder, Dad-style, and I tried not to  remember all the stepfathers before him that had done the same  thing.... They all thought they were permanent, too') and her  brother's infatuation with self-improvement guru Jennifer Anne.

Readers will need to hold on  to their hats as they accompany Remy on her whirlwind ride,  avoiding, circling and finally surrendering to Cupid's arrows.  Almost as memorable as her summer romance with a heartwarmingly  flawed suitor is the cast of idiosyncratic characters who watch  from the sidelines. There's the trio of Remy's faithful  girlfriends, all addicted to 'Xtra Large Zip' Diet  Cokes practical-minded Jess, weepy Lissa, and Chloe, who shares  Remy's dark sense of humor as well as Dexter's entourage of  fellow band members, as incompetent at managing money as they  are at keeping their rental house clean.

        "description": "A celebrated writer's irresistible, candid, and eloquent account of her pursuit of worldly pleasure, spiritual devotion, and what she really wanted out of life Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty, she went through an early- onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want-a husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be.  To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the world-all alone. Eat, Pray, Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali, she studied the art of balance between...",

These innovative private sector partnerships answer perhaps the most pressing issue facing business and thought leaders today&#58; how to practice capitalism in a way that satisfies the need for both profit and a healthy, sustainable planet. Mainwaring provides case studies from companies such as P&G;, Walmart, Starbucks, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Toyota, Nike, Whole Foods, Patagonia, and Nestl&#233; as well as a bold plan for how corporations need to rethink their strategies.",

He believes new technologies aren't merely making life easier, they're making us better&#58; in allowing us to connect with each other across geographic, cultural, and language barriers, the Internet and social media might very well be increasing our capacity for empathy. His 'We First' ethos proposes cooperation between governments, philanthropies, and capitalist corporations to achieve meaningful social transformation. Social media&mdash;viral, borderless&mdash;is the perfect vehicle to promote 'contributory consumerism,' and Mainwaring has fascinating suggestions for technological innovation and systemic change&#58; he proposes a 'Global Brand Initiative'&#58; an association of corporate brands and their advertising partners and competitors that willingly work together (Coke with Pepsi, Greenpeace with WWF, the U.S. with China) to advance corporate social responsibility and charitable donations. Tall orders, all&mdash;but the author's enthusiasm and evidence make an excellent (and counterintuitive) case for big business's ability to make major strides in creating a more equitable world.

        "description": "In July 2005 in Hyde Park, before a global audience of millions, Pink Floyd performed together on stage for the first time in 24 years. From the moment the metronomic pulse of a heartbeat thudded out to begin 'Speak to Me' to the soaring guitar solo that climaxed 'Comfortably Numb,' these self-effacing men in their late fifties stole the show. Almost a year later, the death of their troubled founder-member Syd Barrett made headline news worldwide. Both events signaled a kind of closure to the remarkable tale of one of the world's biggest bands. Now, in the first full-length history of the group for more than fifteen years, Mark Blake tells the story of how a group of middle-class Englishmen conquered the world. Drawing on his own interviews with all of the band members, interviews with the group's friends, road crew, producers, former housemates and university colleagues, as well as musical contemporaries including Pete Townshend and Alice Cooper, Comfortably Numb follows Pink Floyd all the way from the early psychedelic nights at UFO in the mid-sixties to the stadium-rock and concept-album zenith of the seventies, and finally the acrimonious schism that sundered the band in the '80s and '90s.",

And I'm not anything that you think I am anyway.&rdquo;&mdash;Syd Barrett&rsquo;s last interview, Rolling Stone, 1971&#160;Roger Keith &ldquo;Syd&rdquo; Barrett (1946&ndash;2006) was, by all accounts, the very definition of a golden boy. Blessed with good looks and a natural aptitude for painting and music, he was a charismatic, elfin child beloved by all, who fast became a teenage leader in Cambridge, England, where a burgeoning bohemian scene was flourishing in the early 1960s. Along with three friends and collaborators&mdash;Roger Waters, Richard Wright, and Nick Mason&mdash;he formed what would soon become Pink Floyd, and rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll was never the same. Starting as a typical British cover band aping approximations of American rhythm &rsquo;n&rsquo; blues, they soon pioneered an entirely new sound, and British psychedelic rock was born. With early, trippy, Barrett-penned pop hits such as &ldquo;Arnold Layne&rdquo; (about a clothesline-thieving cross-dresser) and &ldquo;See Emily Play&rdquo; (written specifically for the epochal &ldquo;Games For May&rdquo; concert), Pink Floyd, with Syd Barrett as their main creative visionary, captured the zeitgeist of &ldquo;Swinging&rdquo; London in all its Technicolor glory.&#160;But there was a dark side to all this new-found freedom. Barrett, like so many around him, began ingesting large quantities of a revolutionary new drug,...",

In this evocative and lavishly illustrated narrative, Ken Burns and Dayton Duncan delve into the history of the park idea, from the first sighting by white men in 1851 of the valley that would become Yosemite and the creation of the world&#8217;s first national park at Yellowstone in 1872, through the most recent additions to a system that now encompasses nearly four hundred sites and 84 million acres. The authors recount the adventures, mythmaking, and intense political battles behind the evolution of the park system, and the enduring ideals that fostered its growth. They capture the importance and splendors of the individual parks&#58; from Haleakala in Hawaii to Acadia in Maine, from Denali in Alaska to the Everglades in Florida, from Glacier in Montana to Big Bend in Texas. And they introduce us to a diverse cast of compelling characters&#8212;both unsung heroes and famous figures such as John Muir, Theodore Roosevelt, and Ansel Adams&#8212;who have been transformed by these special places and committed themselves to saving them from destruction so that the rest of us could be transformed as well....",

McDougall found a large cast of crazy characters, an exotic setting for drama and discovery, and a tailor-made showdown with which to cap the book. By and large it's a thrilling read, even for someone who couldn't care less about proper stride and split times and energy gels. McDougall's prose, while at times straining to be gonzo and overly clever, is engaging and buddy-buddy, as if he's an enthusiastic friend tripping over himself to tell a great story.",

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of...",

        "review": "In the wake of the great zombie war, Brooks's fictional alter  ego travels around the world to ask tough questions of  individuals and leaders about their experience and actions  before, during and after the undead menace decimated the human  population. Brooks remarkably identifies and articulates the  nuances and unconsidered realities of what a zombie war would  look like. This intriguing 'oral history' stands apart from his  previous zombie-related book, The Zombie Survival Guide, as  Brooks uses the postwar culture here to provide political and  social commentary on a wide range of real-life individuals and  institutions. An all-star cast including Alan Alda, Mark Hamill,  J rgen Prochnow, Henry Rollins, John Turturro, Rob and Carl  Reiner, and many others deliver their parts with such fervor and  intensity that listeners cannot help but empathize with these  characters. Max Brooks acts as the interviewer, providing an  inquisitive but stagnant demeanor. The abridgment keeps the  story tight but struggles with the interviewer's narration  during interviews. When Brooks interrupts characters to indicate  that the person rolled his eyes or appeared apprehensive, his  comments are often moot because the performers are already  portraying such body language with their tone.

It's the stuff of great narrative nonfiction. Eggers&#8230;has given us 21st-century Dickensian storytelling&#151;which is to say, a character-driven potboiler with a point. But here's the real trick: He does it without any writerly triple-lutzes or winks of post modern irony. There are no rants against President Bush, no cheap shots at the authorities who let this city drown. He does it the old-fashioned way: with show-not-tell prose, in the most restrained of voices.",

It features an unforgettable heroine: a brilliant 24-year-old punk-goth computer hacker and private investigator named Lisbeth Salander. Together with Mikael Blomkvist, a financial journalist on a most unusual assignment, she tracks a serial killer through a dangerous maze of business, political, and family secrets.The intricate tale begins when Blomkvist is convicted of libeling top Swedish industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerstr\u00f6m. Unable to prove his innocence, Blomkvist prepares to leave his position at Millennium, the magazine he co-founded, now financially threatened by the verdict. But a summons from Wennerstr\u00f6m's rival, the aging tycoon Henrik Vanger, presents an option he couldn't have imagined: In exchange for Blomkvist's writing the Vanger family history, Vanger promises to back Millennium financially and deliver incriminating evidence of Wennerstr\u00f6m's crooked dealings.But that's not all. The closets of the Vanger clan are littered with skeletons, and his new patron wants Blomkvist to set one at rest: the disappearance, 40 years ago, of Vanger's 16-year-old grandniece, Harriet. Intrigued by the cold case that was never solved despite multiple investigations, Blomkvist begins to dig for new evidence on an island north of Stockholm.He is soon joined by Salander, a freelance investigator originally hired by Vanger to vet Blomkvist's reputation. Multiple piercings and tattoos are belied by the young computer genius's photographic memory. A victim of assault and harrowing abuse, Salander is driven by a relentless will and an astonishing capability for merciless retribution.Larsson's narrative unfolds with mounting suspense, detailing the duo's intellectual ingenuity and increasing courage as they expose hidden cultures of right-wing fanaticism and misogyny and reveal the moral bankruptcy of big capital. As they race across Europe and on to Australia to trap their prey before another woman is tortured and killed, the reader is held in breathless anticipation until the novel's unforeseen conclusion.About the AuthorBorn in V\u00e4sterbotten in northern Sweden in 1954, STIEG LARSSON had a professional career that bears a striking resemblance to that of the protagonist ofThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,Mikael Blomkvist. Beginning as a graphic designer for the news agency Tidningarnas Telegrambyr\u00e5 (TT), Larsson went on to become the chief editor ofExpo,the magazine published by the Expo Foundation, an organization he helped establish in 1995 to combat racism and the Swedish right-wing extremist movement.Inspired by an old joke shared with a colleague at TT, Larsson admitted he started writingThe Girl with the Dragon Tattooat night just for fun. Two other novels, completing the Millennium trilogy, would follow. Describing them as 'pension insurance,' Larsson said he enjoyed the process of fiction writing so much that he didn't make contact with a publisher until he had completed the first two and had a third under way. Though Larsson died of a heart attack in 2004 and never saw any of his books in print, all three were subsequently published in Scandinavia and continental Europe to great acclaim.From Our BooksellersRefreshingly intelligent, this fast-paced mystery draws together an odd cast of underdog journalists, secretive industrialists, and a punk hacker with Asperger's to create the strangest and best thriller of the year, if not decade.

Her new novel,A Visit From the Goon Squad,is a medley of voices&#8230;scrambled through time and across the globe with a 70-page PowerPoint presentation reproduced toward the end. I know that sounds like the headache-inducing, aren't-I-brilliant tedium that sends readers running to nonfiction, but Egan uses all these stylistic and formal shenanigans to produce a deeply humane story about growing up and growing old in a culture corroded by technology and marketing. And what's best, every movement of this symphony of boomer life plays out through the modern music scene, a white-knuckle trajectory of cool, from punk to junk to whatever might lie beyond. My only complaint is thatA Visit From the Goon Squaddoesn't come with a CD.",

Daughters of the Revolution follows an aging, philandering academic, the headmaster of a tony New England prep school, Goddard Byrd, known as 'God' for short to both his friends and his enemies. God has confidently promised coeducation 'over my dead body' just as this New England city is engulfed by the social and political storms of integration, coeducation, second wave feminism and the sexual revolution.  The daughters of this revolution include God's estranged wife; two mistresses; a devoted amanuensis; the angry, brilliant young black artist who becomes his first female pupil; and a fatherless girl who chooses God as her personal patriarch.Searing and beautiful, wry and provocative, and wholly original.",

        "review": "For lack of a life jacket, the trajectory of several lives is altered in this smart, sexy, sarcastic, sophisticated novel from Cooke (The Bostons, a New York Times Notable Book). The Goode School, a prestigious New England bastion of male-only education, designed to prepare its wealthy students to become masters of the universe, represents a microcosm of the social and political upheaval of the past four decades, all overseen by self-important, entitled headmaster Goddard Byrd. In 1968, a typing error results in a scholarship offer to the first Negro female in the school's history, negating Byrd's promise to admit 'girls' over his dead body. Encouraged by the put-upon female faculty and protected by the moneyed Rebozos family, gloriously rebellious Carole Faust upends life at the school. Meanwhile, the drowning of Goode alumnus and doctoral candidate Heck Hellman means that his wife and daughter must struggle through menial jobs and public school education, working their way up to middle-class status until, years later, they cross paths with Carole at a Goode school function. VERDICT Cooke's unique novel defies genre comparisons but has particular relevance as our country's financial woes exacerbate the gap between the power brokers and the rest of us. This cautionary tale deserves wide readership. [See Prepub Alert, 11/29/10.]&mdash;Sally Bissell, Lee Cty. Lib. Syst., Ft. Myers, FL",

Her first cookbook intersperses generous helpings of fascinating personal stories with one hundred of her favorite recipes; an appealing mix of Texas style Mexican, Italian, French, and adventurously eclectic. Like her interviews, Eva's cookbook is entertaining, soulful, and ultimately informative. Definitely a cut above your average celebrity cookbook.",

        "review": "Trinidadian journalist-novelist Naipaul stresses that much has changed since his 1962 trip to India, which yielded his darkly pessimistic book India: A Wounded Civilization. In this kaleidoscopic, layered travelogue, he portrays ``a country of a million little mutinies,'' reeling with ``rage and revolt,'' as percolating ideas of freedom shake loose the old moral ethos rooted in caste and class. Despite what he terms regional, religious and sectarian excesses, Naipaul sees possibilities for regeneration in the new freedoms, yet this skewed essay is fraught with bewilderment and sorrow as he reels off a familiar litany of problems--terrible poverty, shoddy manufactured goods, ugly neo-modern architecture, etc.--and comes to terms with his own past: his ancestors were indentured servants of Indian descent. Most interesting here are the dozens of first-person stories by Indians themselves, ranging from a wealthy young stockbroker to anti-religionists to a publisher of women's magazines. 50,000 first printing; $50,000 ad/promo; author tour.

Then, in 2003, Zuckerberg hacked into Harvard&rsquo;s computers, crashed&#160; the campus network, almost got himself&#160; expelled, and was inspired to create Facebook, the social networking site that has since revolutionized communication around the world.&#160;With Saverin&rsquo;s funding their tiny start-up went from dorm room to Silicon Valley. But conflicting ideas about Facebook&rsquo;s future transformed the friends into enemies.

        "review": "You have to admire Ben Mezrich s chutzpah. To writeThe Accidental Billionaires: Sex, Betrayal and the Founding of Facebook,a supposedly nonfictional narrative about Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, without ever actually speaking to Zuckerberg, reveals an enviable nerve. But then chutzpah is something of a Mezrich speciality. He is the author of the bestsellingBringing Down the House,the story of an elite group of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) geeks who had the nerve to go out west and beat the bank in Las Vegas.  \r\n\r\nWithThe Accidental Billionaires,Mezrich goes a mile or two up Cambridge s Massachusetts Avenue, traveling from MIT to Harvard and telling us the outrageous story of an elite geek who had the chutzpah to go out west and beat the bank in Silicon Valley. Six years ago, Mark Zuckerberg was a monosyllabic Harvard freshman, as brilliant in digital affairs as he was awkward in all things physical. Today, Zuckerberg remains the major shareholder and CEO of a company now valued anywhere between $8 billion and $15 billion.The Accidental Billionairesis the story of Facebook s founding, from the fall of 2003, when Zuckerberg first came up with idea of his online social network, to the fall of 2005, when the Harvard dropout (Bill Gates 2.0) got the company funded by some Silicon Valley venture capitalists. \r\n\r\nThe birth of Facebook is a story about theoretical sex and money but very real betrayal. As the father of the world s most popular social network, Zuckerberg appears anything but social. Mezrich describes the young Facebook founder as not only painfully lacking in social interaction but also chillingly heartless in his dealings with friends and associates. Mezrich s Zuckerberg might be an accidental billionaire today, but there seems nothing accidental about the way in which this Internet enterpreneur relentlessly  borrowed  ideas and money from Harvard classmates and friends without ever properly repaying them. \r\n\r\nGiven that Mezrich never actually spoke to Zuckerberg, this highly energetic and entertaining nonfictional novel should be read with a pinch of salt. But that salt is essential flavoring for this memorable bits-to-billions story. Like the many Facebook pages,The Accidental Billionairesisn t adverse to bending the truth a degree or two. This is a book with nerve about an entrepreneur with nerve. Highly recommended for those with chutzpah who want to go out west and beat the bank.  --Andrew Keen",

Jocks and bullies pick on him constantly, and he has hardly any friends. Then, to make matters worse, he falls in love with an all-American girl...Born to rule over all the monkeys in the world, the story of the Monkey King is one of the oldest and greatest Chinese fables. Adored by his subjects, master of the arts of kung-fu, he is the most powerful monkey on earth. But the Monkey King doesn t want to be a monkey. He wants to be hailed as a god...Chin-Kee is the ultimate negative Chinese stereotype, and he s ruining his cousin Danny s life. Danny s a basketball player, a popular kid at school, but every year Chin-Kee comes to visit, and every year Danny has to transfer to a new school to escape the shame. This year, though, things quickly go from bad to worse...These three apparently unrelated tales come together with an unexpected twist, in a modern fable that is hilarious, poignant, and action-packed. American Born Chinese is an amazing ride, all the way up to the astonishing climax - and confirms what a growing number of readers already know: Gene Yang is a major talent.",

        "review": "As alienated kids go, Jin Wang is fairly run-of-the-mill: he  eats lunch by himself in a corner of the schoolyard, gets picked  on by bullies and jocks and develops a sweat-inducing crush on a  pretty classmate. And, oh, yes, his parents are from Taiwan.  This much-anticipated, affecting story about growing up  different is more than just the story of a Chinese-American  childhood; it's a fable for every kid born into a body and a  life they wished they could escape. The fable is filtered  through some very specific cultural icons: the much-beloved  Monkey King, a figure familiar to Chinese kids the world over,  and a buck-toothed amalgamation of racist stereotypes named  Chin-Kee. Jin's hopes and humiliations might be mirrored in  Chin-Kee's destructive glee or the Monkey King's struggle to  come to terms with himself, but each character's expressions and  actions are always perfectly familiar. True to its origin as a  Web comic, this story's clear, concise lines and expert coloring  are deceptively simple yet expressive. Even when Yang slips in  an occasional Chinese ideogram or myth, the sentiments he's  depicting need no translation. Yang accomplishes the remarkable  feat of practicing what he preaches with this book: accept who  you are and you'll already have reached out to others. (Sept.)

        "review": "Pintoff's debut, winner of the first Minotaur Books/MWA Best First Crime Novel award, will remind many of Caleb Carr at his best. The wreck of the steamshipGeneral Slocumin 1904 cost Det. Simon Ziele of the New York City police both his fianc&eacute;e and the full use of his right arm. In response to those losses, Ziele has abandoned big-city policing for the quiet dullness of Dobson, a town in Westchester County, but a brutal murder interrupts his retreat from the world. Someone slashes and bludgeons to death Sarah Wingate, a Columbia mathematics graduate student whose brilliance evoked jealousy in her peers, in her home under circumstances that resemble the notorious murders of Lizzie Borden's parents. Ziele's investigation is soon co-opted by Alistair Sinclair, a student of criminology who's convinced he knows the culprit's identity. The period detail, characterizations and plotting are all top-notch, and Ziele has enough depth to carry a series.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "review": "The much anticipated Awakened, book eight in the House of Night series, picks up where Burned (St. Martin's, 2010/VOYA October 2010) left off. Though both bear scars from their journey, Zoey and Stark return from the Otherworld bonded, body and soul. Their love and loyalty are pure, an antithesis to Neferet and Kalona's depraved alliance. Neferet, still scheming to bring down Zoey Redbird and all that she stands for, enslaves Kalona's immortal soul for his inability to keep Zoey's soul shattered in Nyx's Realm. Kalona's son is not much better off, skulking in the shadows and fighting his imprint with the red High Priestess, Stevie Rae. Born of hatred and rage, Rephaim cannot reconcile his feelings for her with his monstrous nature. All are at a crossroads and must choose their paths; ultimately, their decisions will affect the outcome of the war between dark and light. The costs are high for such a battle, so the question remains: can Zoey and her friends stand to lose more than they already have? The narrative unfolds at blistering speed. Told from alternating points of view, the novel allows readers new insights into characters' internal conflicts. Exploring themes of social responsibility, integrity, and loss and mortality, the novel does not shy away from difficult subject matter. The friends lose loved ones and the consequences and resulting grief for such loss are explored. Overall, this is a satisfying continuation of the series; readers are left with just enough unanswered questions to keep them clamoring for the next installment. Reviewer: Courtney Huse Wika",

        "review": "With his first foray into teen literature, acclaimed author Sherman Alexie packs a punch in this absorbing novel about a Native American boy searching for a brighter future. At once humorous and stirring, Alexie's novel follows Junior, a resident of the Spokane reservation who transfers out of the reservation's school -- and into a nearby rich, all-white farm school -- in order to nurture his desire to become a cartoonist. Junior encounters resistance there, a backlash at home, and numerous family problems -- all the while relaying his thoughts and feelings via amusing descriptions and drawings. Having already garnered a National Book Award for Young Adult Literature, this moving look at race and growing up is definitely one to oick up.",

LUNCH IN PARIS is a memoir about a young American woman caught up in two passionate love affairs&#151;one with her new beau, Gwendal, the other with French cuisine. Packing her bags for a new life in the world's most romantic city, Elizabeth is plunged into a world of bustling open-air markets, hipster bistros, and size 2 femmes fatales.

Elizabeth finds that the deeper she immerses herself in the world of French cuisine, the more Paris itself begins to translate. French culture, she discovers, is not unlike a well-ripened cheese-there may be a crusty exterior, until you cut through to the melting, piquant heart.Peppered with mouth-watering recipes for summer ratatouille, swordfish tartare and molten chocolate cakes, Lunch in Paris is a story of falling in love, redefining success and discovering what it truly means to be at home.

Their task was to document the activity of an al Qaeda leader rumored to have a small army in a Taliban stronghold. Five days later, only one of those Navy SEALS made it out alive. This is the story of the only survivor of Operation Redwing, fire team leader Marcus Luttrell, and the extraordinary firefight that led to the largest loss of life in American Navy SEAL history. His teammates fought valiantly beside him until he was the only one left alive, blasted by an RPG into a place where his pursuers could not find him. Over the next four days, terribly injured and presumed dead, Luttrell crawled for miles through the mountains and was taken in by sympathetic villagers who risked their lives to keep him safe from surrounding Taliban warriors.A born and raised Texan, Marcus Luttrell takes us from the rigors of SEAL training, where he and his fellow SEALs discovered what it took to join the most elite of the American special forces, to a fight in the desolate hills of Afghanistan for which they never could have been prepared. His account of his squadmates' heroism and mutual support renders an experience for which two of his squadmates were posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for combat heroism that is both heartrending and life-affirming.

        "description": "In an isolated stretch of eastern Kentucky, on a hilltop known as Blade Ridge, stands a lighthouse that illuminates nothing but the surrounding woods. For years the lighthouse has been considered no more than an eccentric local landmark-until its builder is found dead at the top of the light, and his belongings reveal a troubling local history.For deputy sheriff Kevin Kimble, the lighthouse-keeper's death is disturbing and personal. Years ago, Kimble was shot while on duty. Somehow the death suggests a connection between the lighthouse and the most terrifying moment of his life.Audrey Clark is in the midst of moving her large-cat sanctuary onto land adjacent to the lighthouse. Sixty-seven tigers, lions, leopards, and one legendary black panther are about to have a new home there. Her husband, the sanctuary's founder, died scouting the new property, and Audrey is determined to see his vision through.As strange occurrences multiply at the Ridge, the animals grow ever more restless, and Kimble and Audrey try to understand what evil forces are moving through this ancient landscape, just past the divide between dark and light.The Ridgeis the new thriller from international bestseller Michael Koryta, further evidence of why Dean Koontz has said 'Michael Koryta's work resonates into deeper strata than does most of what I read' and why Michael Connelly has named him 'one of the best of the best.'",

She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.She has seen both these dreams come true.At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty onSaturday Night Live; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon -- from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected&#58; you're no one until someone calls you bossy.(Includes Special, Never-Before-Solicited Opinions on Breastfeeding, Princesses, Photoshop, the Electoral Process, and Italian Rum Cake!)",

It is perhaps that healthy sense of incongruity that makes the head writer, executive producer, and star of NBC's Emmy Award-winning 30 Rock such a cogent observer of the contemporary scene. Bossypants, her entertaining new memoir, shows that strangeness has been her constant companion. Fey's stories about her childhood in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania are only appetizers for LOL forays into her college disasters, honeymoon catastrophes, and Saturday Night Live shenanigans. Most funny read of the month; the best possible weekend update.",

What do football players teach us about how to hire teachers? What does hair dye tell us about the history of the 20th century?In the past decade, Malcolm Gladwell has written three books that have radically changed how we understand our world and ourselves&#58; The Tipping Point; Blink; and Outliers. Now, in What the Dog Saw, he brings together, for the first time, the best of his writing from The New Yorker over the same period.Here is the bittersweet tale of the inventor of the birth control pill, and the dazzling inventions of the pasta sauce pioneer Howard Moscowitz. Gladwell sits with Ron Popeil, the king of the American kitchen, as he sells rotisserie ovens, and divines the secrets of Cesar Millan, the 'dog whisperer' who can calm savage animals with the touch of his hand. He explores intelligence tests and ethnic profiling and 'hindsight bias' and why it was that everyone in Silicon Valley once tripped over themselves to hire the same college graduate.'Good writing,' Gladwell says in his preface, 'does not succeed or fail on the strength of its ability to persuade. It succeeds or fails on the strength of its ability to engage you, to make you think, to give you a glimpse into someone else's head.'

Forced out of the NYPD, he's given up the drink. He's thinking seriously about his relationship with sometime girlfriend Jan. Then he runs into 'High-Low' Jack Ellery, a childhood friend from the Bronx. They're two sides of the same coin&#58; Scudder once solved crimes as a detective. Ellery committed them. In Scudder, Ellery sees the moral man he might have become. In Ellery, Scudder sees the hard-won sobriety he hopes to achieve.Then Ellery is killed, shot once in the mouth and once between the eyes, presumably while attempting to atone for past sins. Is it what he saw or what he said that got him killed? Ellery had no family, no friends to press for justice. Scudder reluctantly begins his own investigation, with just one lead-Ellery's Alcoholics Annonymous list of people he wronged. One of them may be a murderer, but that's not necessarily Scudder's greatest danger. Immersing himself in Ellery's world may lead him right back to the bar stool.Exploring themes of loss, nostalgia, and redemption, for Lawrence Block, A DROP OF THE HARD STUFF circles back to how it all began, reestablishing why the Matthew Scudder series is widely regarded as one of the pinnacles of American detective fiction.",

        "review": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewWhy did crime in New York drop so suddenly in the mid-'90s? How does an unknown novelist end up a bestselling author? Why is teenage smoking out of control, when everyone knows smoking kills? What makes TV shows likeSesame Streetso good at teaching kids how to read? Why did Paul Revere succeed with his famous warning?Malcolm Gladwell, a staff writer forThe New Yorker,has been studying trends like these for years and has written several articles for the magazine that have developed into his new book,The Tipping Point. According to Gladwell, the Tipping Point is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire. Just as a sick individual in a crowded store can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small but precisely targeted push start a fashion trend or cause the popularity of a new restaurant to take off overnight or cause crime or drug use to taper off. InThe Tipping Point,Gladwell shows how very minor adjustments in products and ideas can make them more likely to become immensely popular. He reveals how easy it is to cause group behavior to tip in a desirable direction by making small changes in our immediate environment.Gladwell introduces us to the particular personality types that are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail, and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious. He also visits a religiouscommune,a successful high-tech company, and one of the world's greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social epidemics.This is a book that should be read by everyone in business, politics, marketing and advertising, as well as by anyone interested in trends, fashion, fads, policy making, and human behavior. In other words, all of us.(Emily Burg)",

In this second edition, Steve adds three new chapters in the same style as the original&#58; wry and entertaining, yet loaded with insights and practical advice for novice and veteran alike. Don&#39;t be surprised if it completely changes the way you think about Web design.Three New Chapters!Usability as common courtesy -- Why people really leave Web sitesWeb Accessibility, CSS, and you -- Making sites usable and accessibleHelp! My boss wants me to ______. -- Surviving executive design whims'I thought usability was the enemy of design until I read the first edition of this book. Don&#39;t Make Me Think! showed me how to put myself in the position of the person who uses my site. After reading it over a couple of hours and putting its ideas to work for the past five years, I can say it has done more to improve my abilities as a Web designer than any other book.In this second edition, Steve Krug adds essential ammunition for those whose bosses, clients, stakeholders, and marketing managers insist on doing the wrong thing. If you design, write, program, own, or manage Web sites, you must read this book.' -- Jeffrey Zeldman, author of Designing with Web Standards",

We waited five years for a second edition, but it was worth the wait.Krug s principles have aged very well. So, what s new here? First, Krug offers prefabricated emails to your boss, patiently explaining why his/her brainstorm isn t really such a good idea (for instance, why adding visual  sizzle  could be counterproductive). There s a new chapter on building sites that treat users well -- in Krug s words,  behave like a mensch.  There s also an unusually realistic take on accessibility, including five recommendations to follow if you can t revamp your entire site.Thankfully, Krug s humor, brevity, and intelligence remain omnipresent in this edition. Highly recommended -- again.Bill Camarda, from the September 2005Read Only",

        "review": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewWhat makes professional digital photographers' work look so great? In this book, Scott Kelby has rounded up some 150 tips and techniques the pros know and amateurs typically don't. Each technique gets one page, max -- and we're talking about specific information, not abstract theory. Do what Kelby says, and you'll get dramatically better images -- period.Up-front, Kelby explains why professional shots are so much sharper than yours -- and how to create 'tack sharp' images of your own. It starts with the right tripod (and Kelby offers recommendations for every budget). But it doesn't stop there. Kelby covers everything from DSLR mirror lock-up features to steadying handheld shots to sharpening in Photoshop.Then, it's on to six of the most common areas of digital photography: shooting people; landscapes and wildlife; sporting events; weddings; travel and city life; and flowers. Each gets a full chapter of tips: both for using your cameraandfor the non-technical stuff that'll affect your work. (What's the best way to get a big group shot where everyone's got their eyes open? How do you schedule wedding photography to get the best shots of the bride and groom, and still leave time to catch Uncle Arnie?)What's the best way to shoot fireworks, waterfalls, forests, newborn babies? If you miss the winning goal, what do you shoot now? How do you avoid white balance problems? In which season is battery life shortest? How do you keep from accidentally erasing memory cards? How do you show movement in nighttime city shots? It's all here, and with the exception of a few 'throwaway' tips at the front, it's all immensely useful.Bill Camarda, from the December 2006Read Only",

MonoTouch brings the best of CocoaTouch and .NET under a single, extensible technology, providing the only way to develop iOS applications using .NET that can be published to the iOS App Store.Learning MonoTouch begins with the basics of building applications for iOS under MonoTouch. It assumes the reader is familiar with C# and .NET at least on an intermediate level and focuses on making use of existing skills, while presenting iOS-specific information in detail. Initial chapters have simple examples to get the reader up and running and to lay the groundwork for more complex samples and subsequent chapters. After the basics are covered, the book quickly moves into more complex examples that address common use cases encountered in iOS development.Learning MonoTouch is for .NET/C# developers with several years of application development experience, but little to no iOS or Mac development experience. This book teaches C#/.NET developers how to take their existing skills to iOS and shows them how to build iOS applications using MonoTouch.Update&#58; Learning MonoTouch will release as an electronic-only edition (ePub, Kindle, Nook, PDF, and Safari Books Online) in July 2011.

But his mission had barely begun when the vessel was sucked into a mysterious underseas void where time stood still, before propelling it forward, through the centuries. The crew surfaced in a strange, magical world changed forever by nuclear holocaust. Here a race of angelic beings had taken pity on the remnants of humankind, offering a chosen few a precious second chance.Thus the Isle of Hope was raised from the poisoned seas and set like a jewel in Earth's ravaged crown. But the jewel had a flaw, a dark vein of evil. For a sinister expert of the mystical arts had embraced the forbidden third magic, the most deadly sorcery of all.

        "review": "Ever heard of a fat caveman? Today's dieters should follow their ancestors' lead, proclaim the authors of this update to their bestselling original. For hundreds of thousands of years, the human diet consisted of unrefined foods that were high in fiber, low in sugar and low on the glycemic index. Eating similarly now-avoiding white flour, white potatoes, white rice, sugar, soft drinks and highly processed foods in general (the 'basic principles' of a diet that's been 'field-tested by the human digestive system throughout the eons')-will help people lose weight and keep it off, the authors argue. Their reasoning is sound (high blood sugar triggers the release of insulin, the 'fat-storage hormone' and the 'CEO of metabolism'; the less the body lives in fat storage mode, the better), and the lifestyle they propose is simple (though it goes beyond just chucking the 5-lb bag of Domino into the trash). Try eating six small meals a day, don't eat after 8 p.m.; read the labels of all breads and cereals to find the hidden sugars and stock your refrigerator with vegetables and lean meats, the authors say. In chapters that are straightforward and focused, the authors consider childhood obesity and diabetes, discuss artificial sweeteners and alcohol, offer recipes from restaurants around the country and answer FAQs from Sugar Busters everywhere. For those with the willpower to cut out the convenience foods, this will be a helpful guide to eating better. (Jan.)   Copyright 2003 Cahners Business Information.",

Then he makes a shocking discovery&#58; the naked, frozen body of a teenage girl, her skin as white as the snow around her. Even dead, she is the most beautiful girl he&#8217;s ever seen. It is a moment that will forever change his life and the lives of everyone around him. The mysterious dead girl&#8211;the &#8220;Virgin of Small Plains&#8221;&#8211;inspires local reverence. In the two decades following her death, strange miracles visit those who faithfully tend to her grave; some even believe that her spirit can cure deadly illnesses. Slowly, word of the legend spreads.But what really happened in that snow-covered field? Why did young Mitch Newquist disappear the day after the Virgin&#8217;s body was found, leaving behind his distraught girlfriend, Abby Reynolds? Why do the town&#8217;s three most powerful men&#8211;Dr. Quentin Reynolds, former sheriff Nathan Shellenberger, and Judge, Tom Newquist&#8211;all seem to be hiding the details of that night?Seventeen years later, when Mitch suddenly returns to Small Plains, simmering tensions come to a head, ghosts that had long slumbered whisper anew, and the secrets that some wish would stay buried rise again from the grave of the Virgin.

        "review": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewAfter more than a dozen novels, mystery and suspense author -- and longtime Kansan -- Nancy Pickard finally comes home to the Sunflower State inThe Virgin of Small Plains,a hauntingly bittersweet story about the residents of a Kansas town and the grisly secrets some of them have kept buried for 17 years.During a deadly blizzard in 1987, high school senior Rex Shellenberger and his older brother help their father search snow-covered pastures for newborn calves. What Rex finds instead is a breathtakingly beautiful young woman, completely naked and frozen to death, as if she just curled up and fallen asleep. The body is never identified and is eventually buried in an unmarked grave in the town cemetery. But even after 17 years, rumors still swirl around the girl and the mysterious events of that fateful night. How did she get there? Why did Mitch Newquist, the handsome son of the local judge, suddenly leave town -- and Abby, the love of his life -- never again to return? A growing number of people believe that visiting the unmarked grave will bring them miracles -- but there are those in the small town who know there is nothing inspirational about the legend of the Virgin of Small Plains. In fact, it's just the oppositeThe melancholic appeal of this unexpectedly touching novel can be found in the multitude of contradictions associated with small-town America. Pickard fittingly describesThe Virgin of Small Plainsas set in the place 'where Truman Capote proved inIn Cold Bloodthat small Midwestern towns can be the most deadly of all, and where Dorothy proved inThe Wizard of Ozthat there's no place like home.' Just like real life, this novel is full of joy, desire, heartbreak, tragedy -- and, above all else, hope.Paul Goat Allen",

        "review": "Ford's strained debut concerns Henry Lee, a Chinese-American in Seattle who, in 1986, has just lost his wife to cancer. After Henry hears that the belongings of Japanese immigrants interned during WWII have been found in the basement of the Panama Hotel, the narrative shuttles between 1986 and the 1940s in a predictable story that chronicles the losses of old age and the bewilderment of youth. Henry recalls the difficulties of life in America during WWII, when he and his Japanese-American school friend, Keiko, wandered through wartime Seattle. Keiko and her family are later interned in a camp, and Henry, horrified by America's anti-Japanese hysteria, is further conflicted because of his Chinese father's anti-Japanese sentiment. Henry's adult life in 1986 is rather mechanically rendered, and Ford clumsily contrasts Henry's difficulty in communicating with his college-age son, Marty, with Henry's own alienation from his father, who was determined to Americanize him. The wartime persecution of Japanese immigrants is presented well, but the flatness of the narrative and Ford's reliance on numerous cultural clich&eacute;s make for a disappointing read.(Feb.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Following a whirlwind courtship and wedding, the pair set sail for Paris, where they become the golden couple in a lively and volatile group&mdash;the fabled &ldquo;Lost Generation&rdquo;&mdash;that includes Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald.Though deeply in love, the Hemingways are ill prepared for the hard-drinking and fast-living life of Jazz Age Paris, which hardly values traditional notions of family and monogamy.

        "review": "Readers of Ernest Hemingway biographies, his The Sun Also Rises and posthumous memoir A Moveable Feast know at least the outlines of the novelist's relationship with his first wife Hadley Richardson. This rich novel fleshes out that connection, evoking the full rise, throb, and fall of the couple's relationship. As author Paula McClain tells their story, she immerses readers in the jubilation and excesses of Jazz Age, offering us telling glimpses into the lives of the Hemingway's volatile artistic circle. A truly accomplished historical novel; strongly affirmative early reader reports.",

He explores many aspects of this storied, often grim region, which takes up one-seventh of the land on earth. He writes about the geography, the resources, the native peoples, the history, the forty-below midwinter afternoons, the bugs. The book brims with Mongols, half-crazed Orthodox archpriests, fur seekers, ambassadors of the czar bound for Peking, tea caravans, German scientists, American prospectors, intrepid English nurses, and prisoners and exiles of every kind&#8212;from Natalie Lopukhin, banished by the czarina for copying her dresses; to the noble Decembrist revolutionaries of the 1820s; to the young men and women of the People&#8217;s Will movement whose fondest hope was to blow up the czar; to those who met still-ungraspable suffering and death in the Siberian camps during Soviet times.More than just a historical travelogue, Travels in Siberia is also an account of Russia since the end of the Soviet Union and a personal reflection on the all-around amazingness of Russia, a country that still somehow manages to be funny. Siberian travel books have been popular since the thirteenth century, when monks sent by the pope went east to find the Great Khan and wrote about their journeys.

In powerful black-and-white comic strip images, Satrapi tells the story of her life in Tehran from ages six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah's regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution, and the devastating effects of war with Iraq. The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the great-granddaughter of one of Iran's last emperors, Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country.Persepolis paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran: of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life and of the enormous toll repressive regimes exact on the individual spirit. Marjane's child's-eye-view of dethroned emperors, state-sanctioned whippings, and heroes of the revolution allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own extraordinary family. Intensely personal, profoundly political, and wholly original, Persepolis is at once a story of growing up and a stunning reminder of the human cost of war and political repression. It shows how we carry on, through laughter and tears, in the face of absurdity. And, finally, it introduces us to an irresistible little girl with whom we cannot help but fall...",

        "description": "Back in 1957, Theodor Geisel responded to an article in Life magazine that lamented the use of boring reading primers in schools. Using the pseudonym of  'Dr. Seuss' (Seuss was Geisel's middle name) and only two hundred twenty-three words, Geisel created a replacement for those dull primers: 'The Cat in the Hat.' The instant success of the book prompted Geisel and his wife to found Beginner Books, and Geisel wrote many popular books in this series, including 'Hop on Pop,' 'Fox in Socks,' and 'Green Eggs and Ham.' Other favorite titles in this series are 'Go, Dog, Go!' and  'Are You My Mother?' by P. D. Eastman, 'A Fly Went By,' by Mike McClintock, and 'Put Me in the Zoo,' by Robert Lopshire. These affordable hardcover books combine large print, easy vocabulary, and large, bright illustrations in stories kids will want to read again and again.  Grades 1 - Grades 2.",

        "review": "AGERANGE&#58; Ages 9 to 12.One magical cupboard would be enough for a fantasy story, but Wilson offers his twelve-year-old protagonist an even hundred. When Henry York comes to stay with his aunt, uncle, and three female cousins in Henry, Kansas, after his parents have been kidnapped while bicycling across South America, he has hitherto 'led a life that had taught him not to look forward to anything.' But the same dreary landscape that launched Dorothy to Oz here introduces Henry to his uncle's schemes of selling tumbleweeds on E-bay, to the summer joys of sandlot baseball, and to the existence of a wall in his attic bedroom full of mysterious cupboard doors which turn out to be portals across time and space into the fantastic unknown. Wilson is a marvel at crafting delightful sentences, such as 'The paint was scum brown, the sort that normally hides at the bottom of a pond, attractive only to leeches and easily pleased frogs.' Henry is the perfect unlikely fantasy hero, a boy whose parents made him ride in a car seat until he was nine and gave him a protective helmet to wear in P.E. But it is hard to connect with a boy who asks about his absent parents, 'Are they really my parents?' is told, 'Nope,' and then never asks anything about them again. Henry's journeys through cupboard after cupboard become tedious after a while, with too many magical vistas and villains, and the completely unresolved ending feels more like a cheat than a beckoning to read on through the proposed series.

        "review": "Vera Dietz is every teenager, yet she is uniquely herself. The abandoned daughter of a runaway mother, Vera lives with her accountant father who is himself a study in contradictions. An accountant who spouts Zen platitudes, he parents Vera with the firm conviction that steering her away from the pitfalls that tripped him up as a teenager is the only way to save her from herself. Yet, he also shoves her out of the nest and into the adult world of work early in her teen years. Vera rebels against the strict rules and constant warnings. Told not to drink, she becomes a binge drinker. Told not to befriend Charlie Kahn, she falls in love with him only to lose him to the more promiscuous and psychotic Jenny. In alternating voices and viewpoints, the story reveals Charlie and Vera's relationship and Vera and her father's relationship, Vera and her mother's antagonism, and the intermittent voice of Charlie, dead and begging for vindication for the incidents surrounding his death. The plot is complex and the characters are intricate, many-faceted and tragically, humanly flawed. In many ways, this is a psychological thriller as Vera's inner torments play out in dreams and hallucinations of Charlie. Her eventual understanding that her father is actually in her corner is a dawning of maturity, yet she teaches him, as well, that he cannot turn his back on the abuse and dysfunction that produced Charlie's emotional wounds. This is a book for mature teens as there are discussions of pornography and fetishism, but given the right reader, this is a page-turner to be savored and discussed. Reviewer: Lois Rubin Gross",

At the heart of the saga is Syd Barrett, the group's brilliant founder, whose public decline into shattered incoherence--attributable in part to his marathon use of LSD--is one of the tragedies of rock history. The making ofDark Side of the Moonand Floyd's other great albums is recounted in detail, as are the mounting of &quot;The Wall&quot;&#160;&#160;and the creation of the flying pigs, crashing&#160;&#160;planes, &quot;Mr. Screen&quot; and the other elements of their spectacular stage shows. The book also explores the many battles between bass player/song writer Roger Waters and the rest of the group, leading up to Water's acrimonious departure for a solo&#160;&#160;career in 1984 and his unsuccessful attempt to disolve the group he had left behind.Saucerful of Secretsis an electrifying account of this ground-breaking, mind-bending group, covering every period of their career from&#160;&#160;earliest days to latest recordings.

What Atwood could not have intended, and what is no less alarming and exponentially more urgent, is the resonance between her rampaging plague scenario and the recent global outbreak of SARS. Moving from book to newspaper, or newspaper to book, the reader realizes, with a jolt, how the threshold of difference has been lowered in recent months. The force of Atwood's imagining grows in direct proportion to our rising anxiety level. And so does the importance of her implicit caution. &mdash;Sven Birkerts",

Readers may be asking that, too. In The Maze Runner, the teens, their memories erased, searched for a way out of a deadly maze; their escape, led by Thomas, was short-lived. As volume two opens, the boys learn they are infected with the 'Flare,' a virus that has killed millions and produced a population of nearly insane, disease-ravaged 'cranks.' New orders from WICKED, a coalition of surviving governments, have the boys marching across a wasteland toward a promised cure. Though some facts are teased out, the narrative bogs down under the weight of unanswered questions. What is the purpose of torturing these kids? How is making them into killers ensuring the survival of the world? Why would government leaders name themselves WICKED? Hopefully answers are forthcoming in volume three. In any case, fans who are already hooked will gobble this down, particularly those who don't mind anemic female characters and a high body count. Ages 12&#8211;up. (Oct.)",

Maloney's soft-toned narration and  chipper, believably childlike characterization of Bruno  dramatically bring home the fable-like qualities of Boyne's  moving text. Bruno's limited comprehension of all going on  around him begs listeners, presumably with more knowledge than  the protagonist, to glean the fuller story between the lines.  When his father, an officer for 'the Fury,' as Bruno refers to  him, is transferred from Berlin to a new post in Poland called  'Out-With,' Bruno and his family try to adjust. From his new  bedroom window Bruno can see a fenced-in camp where all the  inhabitants wear striped pajamas. He learns more about this  intriguing place when he befriends a boy inside the camp named  Shmuel (who happens to share Bruno's birthday). Their friendship  progresses dangerously and brings Boyne's tale to a shocking end  that is sure to be a discussion starter.

He also crystallized one of the most important debates of our time&#58; As we enjoy the Net&rsquo;s bounties, are we sacrificing our ability to read and think deeply? Now, Carr expands his argument into the most compelling exploration of the Internet&rsquo;s intellectual and cultural consequences yet published. As he describes how human thought has been shaped through the centuries by &ldquo;tools of the mind&rdquo;&mdash;from the alphabet to maps, to the printing press, the clock, and the computer&mdash;Carr interweaves a fascinating account of recent discoveries in neuroscience by such pioneers as Michael Merzenich and Eric Kandel. Our brains, the historical and scientific evidence reveals, change in response to our experiences. The technologies we use to find, store, and share information can literally reroute our neural pathways. Building on the insights of thinkers from Plato to McLuhan, Carr makes a convincing case that every information technology carries an intellectual ethic&mdash;a set of assumptions about the nature of knowledge and intelligence. He explains how the printed book served to focus our attention, promoting deep and creative thought. In stark contrast, the Internet encourages the rapid, distracted sampling of small bits of information from many...",

It falls to Sophie Marx, a young CIA officer with a big chip on her shoulder, to figure out who's doing the killing and why. Her starting point is Alphabet Capital, the London hedge fund that has been providing cover for this secret operation, but the investigation soon widens to include the capitals of the Middle East and the cruel hills of South Waziristan.Sophie thinks she has the backing of her hard-nosed boss, Jeffrey Gertz, and his genial mentor at headquarters, Cyril Hoffman.

Little holes cut in the pages allow toddlers to wiggle their fingers through the food, just like the caterpillar.

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary womenwhose determination to start a movement...",

Miss Eugenia Phelan ('Skeeter' to her friends) is a young woman of privilege who enjoys her fellow Junior Leaguers but sometimes finds their ways at odds with her own principles. She plays the part of her station in 1960s Mississippi but can't help feeling dissatisfied with keeping house and acting as recording secretary at league meetings, and yearns for something more.Minny, Miss Celia, Aibileen, and Yule May are maids employed by Skeeter's friends. Each woman cooks, cleans, and cares for her boss's children, suffering slights and insults silently and sharing household\r\nsecrets only among themselves. In the wake of the Junior League push to create separate bathrooms for the domestic help within private homes, Skeeter contacts a New York book editor with an idea. Soon she's conducting clandestine meetings\r\nwith 'the help' to capture their stories for publication. It is a daring and foolhardy plan, one certain to endanger not only the positions but the lives of the very women whose stories she transcribes -- as well as her own.Stockett is a wonderful novelist, andThe Helpis a charming, thoughtful novel about women finding their voices, and the truths we see when we have the courage to look unflinchingly into the mirror.\r\n(Spring 2009 Selection)",

Yet one day she does the unthinkable&#58; slips a letter into her pocket, reads it, and doesn't deliver it.Meanwhile, Frankie Bard broadcasts from overseas with Edward R. Murrow. Her dispatches beg listeners to pay heed as the Nazis bomb London nightly. Most of the townspeople of Franklin think the war can't touch them.

In this section, Frankie travels on trains across France in 1941 with Jewish refugees trying to reach Spain or Portugal or a boat west to the Americas. Frankie is using a recording technology, Blake admits in an author's note, that wouldn't have been available to her for another two years, but her interviews with the families are profoundly affecting, and the tension is riveting as each visa is checked. The stakes are high for these refugees, and here the novel soars.",

Mick is touched by evil magic, enslaved to a witch, and Janet is concerned there may be no way to free him without killing him.

This time, Myron is given a chance to return to professional basketball after being sidelined by a heartbreaking injury 10 years ago. No, the owner of the New Jersey Dragons doesn't want Myron to play. He wants him to use his skills as a onetime FBI undercover agent ('the worst kept secret in the continental United States') to find a missing player and former rival. The hunt for the absent player turns up an ugly web of complications that include a dead body, blackmail, a nasty custody suit, out-of-control gambling and thugs intent on revenge. Myron finds himself dragged in deeper than expected as the case stirs unresolved issues from his own past. With the help of his lethally loyal pal Win, he untangles the mess with bravado and not a little personal pain. Coben writes a fast-moving narrative in a style witty enough to keep pace without straining too hard. (Dec.)",

        "review": "Drawing on elements from the paranormal world that bestseller  Moning (Spell of the Highlander) created in her earlier  romances, this suspense novel takes readers on a darker journey,  one dominated by the search for a powerful Faery magic and  bereft of the romantic magic Moning's fans have come to expect.  When MacKayla Lane, an ordinary young woman, travels to Ireland  to track down her sister's murderer, she is sucked into an  extraordinary world filled with ancient secrets, vampires,  assorted Fae nasties and other tough-to-kill beings. In the  process, Mac learns of her own unusual talents and finds an  unlikely mentor in the wealthy and mysterious Jericho Barrons.  Moning's newest foray contains suspense and plenty of setup.  Indeed, this reads like a fragment of a larger story, an  introduction to character and place that, while entertaining,  skims the surface. But it's a compelling world filled with  mystery and vivid characters, and this, combined with the hint  of sparks between Jericho and Mac, will stoke readers' fervor  for Bloodfever, the next installment.

But who's behind the clever vandalism and pranks? New Florida resident Roy Eberhardt isn't aware of these goings-on, but he has often noticed a barefoot boy running down the street faster than anything. His curiosity piqued, Roy starts to inquire around and even follows the boy once, only to be told by Beatrice Leep, a.k.a. Beatrice the Bear, to mind his own business. Despite Beatrice's warning and plenty of bullying from the lunkheaded Dana Matherson, Roy follows the boy, whose name is Mullet Fingers, one day and winds up in the middle of an ecological mission to save a parliament of burrowing owls from being bulldozed.Full of colorful, well-developed characters,Hootis a quick-witted adventure that will keep readers hooked. With down-to-earth Roy, dumbfounded Officer Delinko, and construction site manager Curly -- along with other head-shaking morons and uplifting heroes -- the author delivers an appealing cast of characters that keep the plot twisting and turning until the highly charged ending. Another zany trip to the Sunshine State for Hiaasen fans, this rewarding ecological adventure should keep readers young and old hooting with laughter.Matt Warner",

He details many of the unique practices at Zappos, such as their philosophy of allocating marketing money into the customer experience, the importance of Zappos's Core Values ('Deliver WOW through Service'), and the reason why Zappos's number one priority is company culture and his belief that once you get the culture right, everything else - great customer service, long-term branding - will happen on its own.

Interest might flag as Hsieh, fresh off selling his Internet company LinkExchange to Yahoo in 1999 for $265 million, kvetches about lacking fulfillment. But as the tech boom bursts, and Hsieh confronts his dwindling investments, his story comes alive. As the funding for his incubator companies dries up and one of his most promising startups, Zappos.com, a shoe retailer, seems doomed, Hsieh blossoms into a mature businessperson, slashing expenses and presciently making customer service the essence of the company's brand. The story becomes suspenseful as Hsieh recounts the stress of operating in survival mode, liquidating his assets to fund the company in its darkest days and seeking out an 11th-hour loan. By the time Zappos is acquired by Amazon for more than $1.2 billion in 2009, Hsieh and his team had built a unique corporate culture dedicated to employee empowerment and the promise of delivering happiness though satisfied customers and a valued workforce. An uplifting tale of entrepreneurial success, personal growth, and redemption. (June)",

A Klansman who became an absolutist advocate of free speech and civil rights. A backcountry lawyer who started off trying cases about cows and went on to conduct the most important international trial ever. A self-invented, tall-tale Westerner who narrowly missed the presidency but expanded individual freedom beyond what anyone before had dreamed.Four more different men could hardly be imagined. Yet they had certain things in common. Each was a self-made man who came from humble beginnings on the edge of poverty. Each had driving ambition and a will to succeed. Each was, in his own way, a genius.They began as close allies and friends of FDR, but the quest to shape a new Constitution led them to competition and sometimes outright warfare. SCORPIONS tells the story of these four great justices&#58; their relationship with Roosevelt, with each other, and with the turbulent world of the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold War. It also serves as a history of the modern Constitution itself.",

The shocking first strike against Kate occurs in the middle of a recreational sky dive, smartly written by DeMille and heart-thumpingly enacted by Brick. The unwavering Khalil speaks in a slithery, chilling whisper, while series protagonist Corey is full of brashness and bravura. But as the plot proceeds like &ldquo;a straight ball down the middle,&rdquo; a description provided by the author in an interview with the narrator, both of the antagonists begin to display signs of strain. Thanks to Brick, they sound a little more anxious, uncertain, and human the closer they come to their final mano a mano confrontation. A Grand Central hardcover (Reviews, May 10). (June)",

        "review": "Charnas tells the story of hip-hop in this stylish, lavishly detailed love letter to the genre and industry. He follows the money and &ldquo;the relationship between artist and merchant&mdash;who, in hip-hop, are often one and the same&rdquo; from hip-hop&rsquo;s early days as a &ldquo;marginal urban subculture&rdquo; in Harlem of the late 1960s to its insinuation into&mdash;and eventual domination of&mdash;mainstream popular music. Charnas makes an elegant case for how hip-hop is the consummate American art form, one that reflects American society in all its volubility and violence&mdash;as well as possessing the power to alter it. In its promise of economic security and creative control for black artist-entrepreneurs, it is the culmination of the dreams of black nationalists and civil rights leaders. Charnas spent seven years working for Rick Rubin, famed producer and cofounder of Def Jam Records, and writes with the authority of an insider, the passion of a fan, and the cool eye of someone who has maneuvered through the day-to-day working of the business. Nuanced treatment of the impresarios behind signature sounds and recording empires, and brisk, dramatic vignettes, give this history of a leaderless revolution impressive momentum. (Jan.)",

Readers who have wondered at Em's intricate, eye- opening rhyme patterns can also see, first-hand, the way his mind works in dozens of reproductions of his original lyric sheets, written in pen, on hotel stationary, on whatever scrap of paper was at hand.

Roscommon and Galway are proud of their medieval churches, while Ulster villages look toward the Atlantic and seem to be girding themselves against the rigors of the northern climate.

        "review": "In 1980, Jean Auel began her Earth's Children series with her novel The Clan of the Cave Bear. Now, more than 30 years and 45 million copies later, she brings this six-volume Ice Age epic to a reassuring conclusion with The Land of Painted Caves. In this evocative, carefully researched fiction, Cro-Magnon shaman Ayla and her heroic mate Jondalar struggle with environmental upheavals, and threats from wild animals and hostile hunters. Transcending difficulties, this loving, loyal couple find peace and respite in unexpected places and move resolutely towards a more secure future. (P.S. There is good reason why this novel is so eagerly anticipated&#58; The Land of Painted Cave is the first Earth's Children installment in nine years.)",

Which is why she is less than thrilled about being shipped off to boarding school in Paris - until she meets Etienne St. Clair&#58; perfect, Parisian (and English and American, which makes for a swoon-worthy accent), and utterly irresistible. The only problem is that he's taken, and Anna might be, too, if anything comes of her almost-relationship back home.As winter melts into spring, will a year of romantic near - misses end with the French kiss Anna - and readers - have long awaited?",

        "review": "Anna is happy with her life in Atlanta. She has a best friend, a good job, and a potential boyfriend. This idyllic life ends when her dad decides to send her to a boarding school in Paris. Despite her fears and worries, Anna adjusts well to Parisian life and ends up making fast friends with Meredith, Josh, St. Clair and Rashmi. The quintet takes in the sights and frequents the cinemas in Paris while squeezing in some time for homework. As the semester progresses, Anna develops a crush on St. Clair and he seems to return those feelings as they both stay at school over Thanksgiving. Complicating the budding relationship is St. Clair's girlfriend, Ellie. As winter turns into spring, St. Clair stays in the comfortable relationship with Ellie instead of venturing into a new relationship with Anna. This confuses and upsets Anna and she acts out by getting drunk at a school party. Things go from bad to worse when she finds out her potential boyfriend in Atlanta has been dating her best friend. But not to fear, by the end of the book Anna and St. Clair are the new hot couple on campus. Most teen girls will overlook the predictable story elements as they root for Anna and St. Clair to finally make their infatuation official. An allusion is made to teen sex, and underage drinking occurs in the novel. Anna and the French Kiss would be a welcome read to those who have finished all the Sarah Dessen and Simone Elkeles books in the library. Reviewer: Charla Hollingsworth",

Frank Tremont, a world-weary, near-retirement investigator for New Jersey&rsquo;s Essex County, has to face his failure to solve his last case&mdash;the disappearance of a teenage girl. Meanwhile, Dan Mercer stands accused of being a sexual predator thanks to the ambush journalism of Wendy Tynes, a tabloid TV reporter, who must cope with her husband&rsquo;s death caused by a drunken driver as well as reckon with the possibility of Mercer&rsquo;s innocence. When Tynes finds a link between a father of one of Mercer&rsquo;s alleged victims and others felled by scandal, she could become a killer&rsquo;s next victim. If the wealth of characters dilutes the suspense, Coben gives readers lots to think about when judging rights and wrongs. 500,000 first printing; 12-city author tour. (Mar.)",

The fast-paced novel is written in the past tense as a sort of diary from Gemma to Ty, suggesting that she has escaped, though this makes the story no less suspenseful. Ty drugs Gemma in a Bangkok airport and transports her to the home he has built in the isolated Australian outback, believing he&rsquo;s rescuing her from shallow parents and a city life in London she never really fit into. Clever and determined, Gemma gathers her strength and plots numerous escapes to no avail. In the process, she encounters the wildness of her desert surroundings and carefully digs for Ty&rsquo;s weaknesses, patching together his complex history, including the extent of his six-year obsession with her. Gemma&rsquo;s fluctuating emotions are entirely believable&mdash;she&rsquo;s repulsed by Ty, but can&rsquo;t help recognizing the ways in which he&rsquo;s opened her eyes. It&rsquo;s a haunting account of captivity and the power of relationships. Ages 14-up. (May)",

Although Tattawa High School in rural New England closes early for snow, basketball player Scotty and fellow sophomores Jason and Pete stay late to work on Jason's go-kart. By the time they realize that the storm is too strong for their parents to pick them up, they're trapped along with four other students (and a teacher, who quickly leaves to seek help). They're already out of cellphone range, and when the power goes out, all hope of communicating with the outside world is lost. As the snow piles up to over 10 feet, the captive students do their best to survive and wait for help. The problems are expected&mdash;darkness, infighting, jealousy, illness, hunger&mdash;but conveyed with a tight sense of realism through Scotty's narrative voice. He tells readers early on that 'not all of us made it,' so the surprise is less that things keep going wrong than how they do. Northrop's solid storytelling should keep readers rapt. Ages 15 up.

Against them he sent his most formidable servant, Glaurung, a powerful spirit in the form of a huge wingless dragon of fire. Into this story of brutal conquest and flight, of forest hiding-places and pursuit, of resistance with lessening hope, the Dark Lord and the Dragon enter in direly articulate form. Sardonic and mocking, Glaurung manipulated the fates of T&#250;rin and Ni&#235;nor by lies of diabolic cunning and guile, and the curse of Morgoth was fulfilled.&#147;The earliest versions of this story by J.R.R.

Tolkien'sThe Children of H\u00farin(begun in 1918 and never fully completed) is like the unearthing of a long-lost holy book. The dark, wartorn epic of love and loss, set in the First Age of Middle-earth, is one of Tolkien's three Great Tales of the Elder Days (along with Beren and L&uacute;thien and the Fall of Gondolin), and according to Christopher Tolkien in the novel's preface, it is 'integral' to understanding the complex history of Elves and Men in Middle-earth.While fighting side by side with Elven allies against the evil Morgoth and his minions of Orcs, H\u00farin Thalion -- one of the greatest warriors of the First Age -- is captured and brought back to Morgoth's stronghold, where the Great Enemy places a curse, a 'dark doom,' on the hero and his offspring. Imprisoned atop a mountain peak, H\u00farin is forced to witness the horrific ordeals that beset his son T\u00farin and his daughter NienorEasily the most monumental publishing event of 2007,The Children of H\u00farinis an absolute must-read for fans ofThe HobbitandThe Lord of the Rings,as well as for genre historians and fantasy aficionados alike. Featuring spectacular illustrations from the legendary Alan Lee, Tolkien's oldest -- and arguably darkest -- Middle-earth tale is replete with grand-scale adventure, awe-inspiring magic, and one the most unforgettably heroic (and tragic) story lines genre fans will ever experience. This heartrending tale of T\u00farin and Nienor will undoubtedly become one of the most popular chronicles of Middle-earth. Classic Tolkien.Paul Goat Allen",

Relying on doctored, store-bought cake mixes and the option of canned frostings, recipe time is used primarily for assembling and decorating cupcakes that take the form of animals, food items, and holiday-inspired scenes.

Basic techniques, including filling cupcake liners and frosting cupcakes, are explained, and recipes are formatted into clear, easy-to-understand numbered steps accompanied by full-color photos. Kids and adults alike will find joy in the many artful creations, including a &ldquo;pizza&rdquo; supported by cupcakes and topped with fruit &ldquo;pepperoni&rdquo;; a banana split with cupcakes in the form of ice cream scoops, and Chinese takeout complete with Tootsie Roll broccoli florets.

The summer of peace and plenty, ten years long, is drawing to a close, and the harsh, chill winter approaches like an angry beast. Two great leaders--Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon&#151;who held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead...victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war.As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky&#151;a comet the color of blood and flame&#151;six factions struggle for control of a divided land.

She has retained all the particularly good, tried-and-true recipes from preceding editions, retesting and rewriting when necessary. She has rediscovered lost treasures, including delicious recipes that were eliminated when practically no one baked bread at home.

Martin's Game ContinuesIn 1996,A Game of Thronesearned praise and awe as a remarkable high fantasy introducing five noble families clashing for power over the wondrous Seven Kingdoms. Three years later,A Clash of Kingsbecame a national bestseller with the continued chronicles of the royal houses of Targaryen, Baratheon, Lannister, Stark, and Greyjoy, each battling to keep or carve a kingdom. George R. R. Martin will draw a new legion of fans withA Storm of Swords,the third novel in his beloved fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire.Fourteen-year-old exiled queen Daenerys Targaryen raises an army like a fantasy-world Joan of Arc, but the fire is on her side, for she walks with dragons. Determined to claim the Iron Throne from which her father had ruled until he was slain by Prince Jaime Lannister, Daenerys walks a gauntlet of  treacherous slavers and sorcerers.The war between Lannisters and Baratheons that concludedA Clash of Kingshas not ended. Clever Tyrion Lannister, called the Imp for his short and crippled stature, struggles to retain his honor and authority as his father, Lord Tywin, and his elder sister, Cersei, as beautiful and evil as the witch Circe ofThe Odyssey, turn every hand against him. Though he longs\r\nonly to live with his loving mistress, Shae, Tyrion's desires are as cruelly thwarted as those of young Sansa Stark, who once loved the immature, sadistic King Joffrey Lannister and who seeks to escape.With noble Lord Stark executed for treason, his family is scattered. Lady Catelyn counsels her valiant son Robb, the King in the North, to seek not revenge but justice as he makes war against the Lannisters. Tomboy Arya is afoot in the wilderness, having lost both her pet wolf and her sword, though gaining surprising new friends, and young Bran Stark learns he has a latent and peculiar magical talent.Jon Snow, bastard son of Stark and a Brother of the Night's Watch, treads the most perilous path of all. Ordered on an undercover mission north of the great Wall to discover the plans of the renegade Mance Rayder, he finds not only a powerful army raised to invade the Kingdoms but also terrifying supernatural creatures in pursuit, of which giants and shape-changers are by no means the deadliest.Book Three of A Song of Ice and Fire is inexpressibly rich in both humor and horror.A Storm of Swordsis eerily atmospheric, with tales of old hauntings, dreams of bad omen, the writhing air of ghosts, and ruins. Martin's gift for imagining histories within histories, fables and superstitions, marvelous geographies, and the secrets of the heart is so enthralling that no reader can possibly be satisfied until the next chapter of the saga appears.--Fiona KelleghanFiona Kelleghan is a librarian at the University of Miami.

R. Martin&rsquo;s monumental epic cycle of high fantasy that began with A Game of Thrones. Now, in A Feast for Crows, Martin delivers the long-awaited fourth book of his landmark series, as a kingdom torn asunder finds itself at last on the brink of peace . .&#160;. only to be launched on an even more terrifying course of destruction.A Feast for CrowsIt seems too good to be true. After centuries of bitter strife and fatal treachery, the seven powers dividing the land have decimated one another into an uneasy truce. Or so it appears. . . . With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in King&rsquo;s Landing. Robb Stark&rsquo;s demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exist&mdash;or they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so long, has burned itself out.But as in the aftermath of any climactic struggle, it is not long before the survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters start to gather, picking over the bones of the dead and fighting for the spoils of the soon-to-be dead.

        "review": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewA Feast for Crows,the long-awaited fourth installment of George R.&nbsp;R. Martin's shelf-splitting A Song of Ice and Fire saga, continues the bloody drama of the war-torn Seven Kingdoms and the battle for the Iron Throne. With the king dead and a child on the throne, Cersei -- the Queen Regent -- must protect her son from myriad enemies vying for control of the realm. As the novel's title implies, although the War of the Five Kings is over, death and destruction are still rampant.Fans of Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire (A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings,andA Storm of Swords) may find this installment a bit unusual -- half the epic's previous plot threads are not even touched upon. Because of the unwieldy size of the finished manuscript (1,500-plus pages), Martin explains his and his publisher's decision to split the book into two volumes: 'It was my feeling that we were better off telling all the story for half the characters, rather than half the story for all the characters. Cutting the novel in half would have produced two half-novels; our approach will produce two novels taking place simultaneously, but set hundreds or even thousands of miles apart, and involving different casts of characters.'Cliffhangers abound in this fourth volume of Martin's spectacularly grandiose narrative -- an epic comparable to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time cycle and Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth saga that features literally hundreds of major characters. (The appendix of dramatis personae is more than 60 pages long!) After finishingA Feast for Crows,fans will be (justifiably) ravenous for the next installment (tentatively titledA Dance with Dragons) to find out what is happening with popular characters not mentioned: namely, Tyrion Lannister, Davos Seaworth, and the enigmatic Mother of Dragons, Daenerys Stormborn.Paul Goat Allen",

Now she continues the adventures of one of her most popular heroes in the first book of what promises to be her most spectacular trilogy yet.Fool&#8217;s ErrandFor fifteen years FitzChivalry Farseer has lived in self-imposed exile, assumed to be dead by almost all who once cared about him. But that is about to change when destiny seeks him once again. Prince Dutiful, the young heir to the Farseer throne, has vanished and FitzChivalry, possessed of magical skills both royal and profane, is the only one who can retrieve him in time for his betrothal ceremony--thus sparing the Six Duchies profound political embarrassment...or worse. But even Fitz does not suspect the web of treachery that awaits him or how his loyalties to his Queen, his partner, and those who share his magic will be tested to the breaking point.",

        "review": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewFool's Errand,part of Robin Hobbs's Tawny Man series, takes place approximately 15 years after the events in the Farseer trilogy and continues chronicling the life of FitzChivalry Farseer, a heroic young boy introduced inAssassin's Apprentice. Fitz, as he is called, is the bastard son of Prince Chivalry and is treated as an outcast by the whole royal court -- everyone, that is, except King Shrewd, who has him secretly trained in the arts of the assassin. He is made even more invaluable to the king because of his Skill, a hereditary magical power that allows Fitz to telepathically communicate with other Farseers and spiritually bond with animals, among other things. As the series progresses, Fitz grows up and begins to come to grips with his incredible power -- and the responsibility that goes along with it.Here we rediscover FitzChivalry Farseer as a much older man (though by the way he speaks, you would think he was ancient!). He's living with his bonded wolf, Nighteyes, and a young boy he is raising named Hap. They share an isolated life in a small cabin in the deep woods. Fitz now goes by the name of Tom Badgerlock and refuses to go back to the Buckkeep. He is, after all, supposed to be dead. Both Fitz and Nighteyes are aging, and Fitz is pretending to enjoy his life of inactivity. This contentedness is severely tested when he gets a visit from some old friends.Fitz's old mentor Chade arrives first, showing signs of having the ability to Skill. The only other person known to have this ability is Fitz himself. Chade wants Fitz to return with him to Buckkeep and train the young Prince Dutiful in the art, but he adamantly refuses. Two more old friends visit Fitz, and the news is not good. The Witted, it seems, are being persecuted throughout the Six Duchies because of their bonds with animals. To complicate matters, Prince Dutiful -- soon to be married -- is missing. Fitz's assignment to get him back in time for the wedding ceremony seems like a fool's errand, but the hazards ahead could signal the end of the Six Duchies as he knows it.FYI: Readers don't have to have read Hobb's Farseer novels before beginning this book (though, in all honesty, it does add to the experience). Hobb masterfully slips in the needed background information smoothly and concisely. Within the first few chapters, all readers should have a solid grasp on the realm of the Six Duchies, and on Fitz and his previous history.Fool's Errandis one heck of a good read: it is fast-paced, there's a ton of action and adventure, and fans of Hobb's Farseer series will thoroughly enjoy getting to know Fitz again as an adult.(L.E.)",

Maarten Troost has charmed legions of readers with his laugh-out-loud tales of wandering the remote islands of the South Pacific. When the travel bug hit again, he decided to go big-time, taking on the world&#8217;s most populous and intriguing nation. In Lost on Planet China, Troost escorts readers on a rollicking journey through the new beating heart of the modern world, from the megalopolises of Beijing and Shanghai to the Gobi Desert and the hinterlands of Tibet. Lost on Planet China finds Troost dodging deadly drivers in Shanghai; eating Yak in Tibet; deciphering restaurant menus (offering local favorites such as Cattle Penis with Garlic); visiting with Chairman Mao (still dead, very orange); and hiking (with 80,000 other people) up Tai Shan, China&#8217;s most revered mountain. But in addition to his trademark gonzo adventures, the book also delivers a telling look at a vast and complex country on the brink of transformation that will soon shape the way we all work, live, and think. As Troost shows, while we may be familiar with Yao Ming or dim sum or the cheap, plastic products that line the shelves of every store, the real China remains a world&#8212;indeed, a planet--unto itself....",

        "review": "Starred Review.In his latest, veteran traveler Troost (The Sex Lives of Cannibals, Getting Stoned with Savages) embarks on an extended tour of 'the new wild west,' China. Troost travels from the megalopolis of Beijing to small, remote trails in the hinterlands, the fabled Shangri-La and all points in between, allowing for a substantive look at an incredibly complex culture. He does an admirable job of summing up the country's rich history, venturing to Nanjing to learn about China's deep-seated animosity toward Japan; he also visits the Forbidden City, and the tomb of Mao Zedong, still very much revered despite his horrific record of human rights abuses. Gross disparity in wealth, omnipresent pollution and the teeming mass of humanity that greet Troost at every opportunity wear on him and the reader alike; the sense of claustrophobia only relents when he gets into more remote areas. Throughout, Troost is refreshingly upbeat, without a hint of ugly American elitism; he often steps aside to let the facts speak for themselves, and rarely devolves into complaints over the language barrier or other day-to-day frustrations. Those looking for tips on Hong Kong night life or other touristy secrets will be disappointed-few names are named-but readers interested in a warts-and-all look at this complicated, evolving country will find this a rich education.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "review": "If she hadn't looked at the picture, Betty Gleeson would have dropped the flyer in the waste paper basket. Instead, she stopped, transfixed: The missing boy in the photo looked identical to her adopted son. This seasoned reporter knew that Will's adoption had been totally aboveboard, but there was something that compelled her to pursue this eerie coincidence. In that moment, she made a decision that would thrust her into a hunt she can't abandon and a struggle she might not survive. Binding family ties; building suspense; sudden surprises.",

This time, Myron is given a chance to return to professional basketball after being sidelined by a heartbreaking injury 10 years ago. No, the owner of the New Jersey Dragons doesn't want Myron to play. He wants him to use his skills as a onetime FBI undercover agent ('the worst kept secret in the continental United States') to find a missing player and former rival. The hunt for the absent player turns up an ugly web of complications that include a dead body, blackmail, a nasty custody suit, out-of-control gambling and thugs intent on revenge. Myron finds himself dragged in deeper than expected as the case stirs unresolved issues from his own past. With the help of his lethally loyal pal Win, he untangles the mess with bravado and not a little personal pain. Coben writes a fast-moving narrative in a style witty enough to keep pace without straining too hard. (Dec.)",

I haven&#8217;t read it yet&#8212;I&#8217;ve just picked it up and casually glanced at the back cover. There clearly isn&#8217;t a plot. I&#8217;ve heard there&#8217;s a lot of stuff about time travel in this book, and quite a bit about violence and Garth Brooks and why Germans don&#8217;t laugh when they&#8217;re inside grocery stores. Ralph Nader and Ralph Sampson play significant roles. I think there are several pages about Rear Window and college football and Mad Men and why Rivers Cuomo prefers having sex with Asian women. Supposedly there&#8217;s a chapter outlining all the things the Unabomber was right about, but perhaps I&#8217;m misinformed. Q&#58; Is there a larger theme? A&#58; Oh, something about reality. 'What is reality,' maybe? No, that&#8217;s not it. Not exactly. I get the sense that most of the core questions dwell on the way media perception constructs a fake reality that ends up becoming more meaningful than whatever actually happened. Also, Lady Gaga. Q&#58; Should I read this book? A&#58; Probably. Do you see a clear relationship between the Branch Davidian disaster and the recording of Nirvana&#8217;s In Utero? Does Barack Obama make you want to drink Pepsi? Does ABBA remind you of AC/DC? If so, you probably don&#8217;t need to read this book. You probably wrote this book.

Soon this tall, outspoken gal from Pasadena, California, who didn&#8217;t speak a word of French and knew nothing about the country, was steeped in the language, chatting with purveyors in the local markets, and enrolled in the Cordon Bleu.After managing to get her degree despite the machinations of the disagreeable directrice of the school, Julia started teaching cooking classes herself, then teamed up with two fellow gourmettes, Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle, to help them with a book they were trying to write on French cooking for Americans. Throwing herself heart and soul into making it a unique and thorough teaching book, only to suffer several rounds of painful rejection, is part of the behind-the-scenes drama that Julia reveals with her inimitable gusto and disarming honesty.Filled with the beautiful black-and-white photographs that Paul loved to take when he was not battling bureaucrats, as well as family snapshots, this memoir is laced with wonderful stories...",

But his bonhomie disappears when he comes to Lewis, who tweaked Gilbert's nose, and Margaret, who teased him about his glasses. As the clever, kid-obliging title attests, Gilbert does not make nice on their cards; to escape the consequences, he signs Margaret's name to Lewis's Valentine and vice versa. Of course, when neither receives a card signed with Gilbert's name, the identity of the prankster is clear. In a predictable resolution to this sweet if minor tale, Gilbert does the right thing and composes friendly Valentines to the two, who apologize for having hurt his feelings. The winning touch here is de Groat's (Annie Pitts, Swamp Monster) characteristically buoyant watercolor art, which features an amiable crew of assorted animals, many festively clad in Valentine's Day-appropriate reds and pinks.

It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study.The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work&#151;recording things that matter.

No, that doesn t do it justice. Imagine learning Java from Robin Williams. (The comedian, we mean. If you can imagine him as a trulygreatJava programmer.)Synapses firing, new ideas, new connections, attitude all over the place: That sHead First Java. (Where else can you watch Java objects expose their inner secrets on Java Tabloid TV? Or learn why Lucyreallykeeps her variables private?)Hilarious captioned photos. Text that s actually funny (and we don t mean the kind of  alleged  funny you ve seen in computer books before -- the kind that makes youcringe). Games. Puzzles. Mysteries.  Be the compiler  exercises. Great analogies.And all these goodies weren t bolted on at the end to enliven a deadly narrative or fit a format. They re here to make the ideas come alive. And it works.If you prefer to be lectured, if you prefer a rigid format where you know exactly what to expect every time you turn the page look elsewhere.Head First Javahas a surprise waiting on pretty much every spread. Kathy Sierra, Bert Bates, and the gang at O Reilly figure that people learn best when they re fully engaged. When they re being tickled. When they re on the floor laughing. (And the latest research in cognitive science, neurobiology, and educational psychology backs them up.)In Chapter 1, you ll build your first app -- not Hello World, but your own personal Phrase-O-Matic. Then, it s straight outta main() -- or, as the authors put it,  We re leaving this dusty old procedural town for good.  You ll learn why objects are better through an imaginary competition between Larry, the procedural programmer and Brad, the OO guy (winner gets the cool Aeron chair).Next, it s on to primitive and reference variables. Think of  em as cups. Think of 64 and Double 64 primitives as Starbucks Grande cups. Java cares about type and won t let you put a Giraffe into a Rabbit variable:  What happens when someone tries to ask the so-called Rabbit to hop()? You ll get to know life -- and death -- on the garbage collectible heap. There s a full chapter on object behavior and on encapsulation ( do it or risk humiliation and ridicule ).One big idea at a time, you make it through every Java fundamental. Solving problems with the Java Library APIs. Inheritance. Object-oriented design. Serious polymorphism, and interfaces:  the caffeine in Java.  Constructors. Memory management. Garbage collection. Java math (static methods and variables, math methods, wrappers, and number formatting). Exception handling. GUIs, event handling, layout managers, and Swing components. Object serialization. File I/O. Networking and threads. Even getting your code ready for release (e.g., code organization, packages, executable JARs, and Java Web Start (which launches your application for the first time as a web browser and then runs it on a stand-alone basis).ThroughoutHead First Java,you ll also find answers to the  dumb questions  other books don t deign to answer. Oh, and plenty of  Ready-bake code.  You ll never forget this Java book -- or what you learn from it.Bill CamardaBill Camarda is a consultant, writer, and web/multimedia content developer.

While Washington offers only the politics of blame and fear, Jim Wallis, the man who changed the conversation about faith and politics, has traveled the country and found a nation hungry for a politics of solutions and hope. He shows us that a revival is happening, as people of faith and moral conviction seek common ground for change.Wallis also reminds us that religious faith was a driving force behind our greatest national reforms, such as the abolition of slavery and the civil rights movement. These 'great awakenings' happened periodically at crucial times in our nation's history to propel us toward the common good. The time is ripe for another movement that will transform this country. WithThe Great Awakening, Wallis helps us rediscover our moral center and provides both the needed inspiration and a concrete plan to hold politics accountable and find solutions to our greatest challenges.",

When Erin goes to summer camp, Jason breaks up with her and Lani starts seeing him in secret. Lani and Erin are both obsessed with fate--horoscopes, birth charts, dream analysis, etc.--and Lani must decide if her relationship with Jason is meant to be, even if it is what a fortune teller predicted will destroy her bond with Erin. Readers will understand both Lani's connection with Jason, who 'feels like home,' and her bond with Erin, which was crystallized when they were in a car accident years earlier, but has been weakening. Erin's reaction to the romance is intense, and Lani soon find herself a social outcast, while her friendship with her closeted gay friend, Blake, is strained after he's outed and harassed. Lani's obsession with the mystical can feel more like a device than an innate part of her personality, but her struggle with fate nonetheless adds needed depth to this familiar romantic triangle.

Once again, Geraldine Brooks takes a remarkable shard of history and brings it to vivid life. In 1665, a young man from Martha's Vineyard became the first Native American to graduate from Harvard College. Upon this slender factual scaffold, Brooks has created a luminous tale of love and faith, magic and adventure. The narrator of Caleb's Crossing is Bethia Mayfield, growing up in the tiny settlement of Great Harbor amid a small band of pioneers and Puritans. Restless and curious, she yearns after an education that is closed to her by her sex. As often as she can, she slips away to explore the island's glistening beaches and observe its native Wampanoag inhabitants. At twelve, she encounters Caleb, the young son of a chieftain, and the two forge a tentative secret friendship that draws each into the alien world of the other. Bethia's minister father tries to convert the Wampanoag, awakening the wrath of the tribe's shaman, against whose magic he must test his own beliefs. One of his projects becomes the education of Caleb, and a year later, Caleb is in Cambridge, studying Latin and Greek among the colonial elite. There, Bethia finds herself reluctantly indentured as a housekeeper and can closely observe Caleb's crossing of cultures. Like Brooks's beloved narrator Anna in Year of Wonders, Bethia proves an emotionally irresistible guide...",

From the cabaret to the Broadway stage, from television and film stardom to her acclaimed work as a director, from the recording studio to the concert hall, she has demonstrated that the extraordinary voice that launched her career was only one of her remarkable gifts. Now, in her first book, Barbra Streisand reveals another aspect of her talent&#58; the taste and style that have inspired her beautiful homes and collections. My Passion for Design focuses on the architecture and construction of her newest homes, the dream refuge that she has longed for since the days when she shared a small Brooklyn apartment with her mother, brother, and grandparents. A culmination and reflection of Streisand's love of American architecture and design between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries, the book contains many of her own photographs of the rooms she has decorated, the furniture and art she has collected, and the ravishing gardens she has planted on her land on the California coast. In addition to glimpses of her homes, Barbra shares memories of her childhood, the development of her sense of style, and what collecting has come to mean to her.

        "description": "A richly inventive novel about a centuries-old vampire, a spellbound witch, and the mysterious manuscript that draws them together.Deep in the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, young scholar Diana Bishop unwittingly calls up a bewitched alchemical manuscript in the course of her research. Descended from an old and distinguished line of witches, Diana wants nothing to do with sorcery; so after a furtive glance and a few notes, she banishes the book to the stacks. But her discovery sets a fantastical underworld stirring, and a horde of daemons, witches, and vampires soon descends upon the library. Diana has stumbled upon a coveted treasure lost for centuries-and she is the only creature who can break its spell.Debut novelist Deborah Harkness has crafted a mesmerizing and addictive read, equal parts history and magic, romance and suspense. Diana is a bold heroine who meets her equal in vampire geneticist Matthew Clairmont, and gradually warms up to him as their alliance deepens into an intimacy that violates age-old taboos. This smart, sophisticated story harks back to the novels of Anne Rice, but it is as contemporary and sensual as theTwilightseries-with an extra serving of historical realism.",

The Greenlaws (Linda is the author of The Hungry Ocean and Seaworthy) divide the book into such chapters as 'Cocktails, Snacks, and Sunsets,' 'Light Lunches and Suppers for Lazy Summer Days,' and 'Feasts with Family and Friends.' Recipes showcase seasonal Maine treasures, such as blueberries (martinis with mixed berry simple syrup, chilled berry soup, ginger-bran blueberry muffins, cinnamon-blueberry ice cream); seafood (beer-steamed clams, stuffed lazy lobster, blackened swordfish); and plenty of garden vegetables. Dishes are geared toward entertaining, with Maine shrimp gazpacho, mushroom and radish carpaccio with shaved manchego and creamy lemon-pepper drizzle, and cucumbers with green sour cream cumin dressing; abundant, too, are grilled dishes like blue cheese burgers with bourbon black tea ketchup, swordfish kebabs with peanut-ginger dipping sauce, and spareribs with Dr Pepper glaze. Essays on rafting up, the annual pig roast, and cooking aboard ship during a monthlong swordfishing expedition further personalize the book. (July)",

His Sundance Film Festival transformed the world of filmmaking; his films defined a generation.

        "description": "When the delegates left the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in September 1787, the new Constitution they had written was no more than a proposal. Elected conventions in at least nine of the thirteen states would have to ratify it before it could take effect. There was reason to doubt whether that would happen. The document we revere today as the foundation of our country&#8217;s laws, the cornerstone of our legal system, was hotly disputed at the time. Some Americans denounced the Constitution for threatening the liberty that Americans had won at great cost in the Revolutionary War. One group of fiercely patriotic opponents even burned the document in a raucous public demonstration on the Fourth of July. In this splendid new history, Pauline Maier tells the dramatic story of the yearlong battle over ratification that brought such famous founders as Washington, Hamilton, Madison, Jay, and Henry together with less well-known Americans who sometimes eloquently and always passionately expressed their hopes and fears for their new country. Men argued in taverns and coffeehouses; women joined the debate in their parlors; broadsides and newspaper stories advocated various points of view and excoriated others. In small towns and counties across the country people read the document carefully and knew it well. Americans seized the opportunity to play a role in shaping the new nation. Then the ratifying conventions chosen by 'We the People' scrutinized and debated the Constitution...",

Suddenly things like school and house parties and fun times with friends are replaced by visits to Nia's pediatrician and countless social workers who all say that the only way for Nia and Bobby to lead a normal life is to put their baby up for adoption. Then tragedy strikes Nia, and Bobby finds himself in the role of single, teenage father. Because his child--their child--is all that remains of his lost love.With powerful language and keen insight, Johnson tells the story of a young man's struggle to figure out what the &quot;right thing&quot; is and then to do it.

        "review": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewAuthor Angela Johnson follows up her Coretta Scott King Award&#150;winning novel,Heaven,with this absorbing prequel about a single teen struggling to accept his new paternal role.In chapters that flash between Bobby's relationship with Nia leading up to Feather's birth (entitled 'then') and his life now that he's a father on his own ('now'), Johnson paints an honest, vivid portrait of a man straddling the line between childhood and adulthood. Throughout the book, Bobby fights his own sleep deprivation and desire to hand off Feather to someone else for caretaking, and in one tense episode, he takes off to go spray-painting while his daughter is looked after by a neighbor. Chapter by chapter the events surrounding Bobby's situation become clearer, and after the narrative reaches a pivotal chapter (called 'Nia') that marks Bobby's transformation into single parenthood, the true surprise comes near the end, when we learn what has happened to Feather's mom that eventually spurs Bobby to move to Heaven, Ohio.In a powerful, spare read that will grip you on several levels, Johnson delivers a worthy continuation ofHeaven.The characters' relationship dynamics -- Bobby with Nia, his parents, and Feather -- are deep yet subtle, while the book's main character is one not often found in young adult literature.The First Part Lastis an original read that will stir you to the core.Matt Warner",

        "review": "Two years ago, Caleb claimed responsibility for a drunken hit-and-run accident leaving Maggie, best friend to his twin sister, Leah, with a permanently impaired leg. Now eighteen and home from juvenile detention, his friends' animosity, family's breakdown, and subsequent messy romance with Maggie convince him everyone would benefit from his absence, so he abruptly flees and ceases all communication. Caleb resurfaces some eight months later, after hitting rock bottom, and reluctantly contacts his juvenile counselor for help. Assistance means warily entering ReSTART, a program where those affected by teen reckless driving share their stories and drastically changed lives with high-risk adolescents. Caleb and Maggie's emotions freefall upon discovering each other in the program, especially as each is keeping the same secret: Leah caused the accident, with Caleb uninvolved but rashly promising to protect her. Caleb hardly suspects that Maggie has surmised the truth, but she realizes everyone's healing is dependent upon Leah's truthfulness and wants the silence ended. She is, however, uncertain how to approach the volatile subject. Alternately narrated by Caleb and Maggie, this utterly realistic story is engrossing, especially the thorny relationships and fractured families. The plot continually progresses, allowing the characters' growth in increasingly complicated situations, with compelling interactions among other ReSTART members and speaking audiences. Readers will probably find the ending either sappy or swoon-worthy, but plausible. Although promoting automobile safety, the larger message demonstrates that one careless lie, regardless of intention, can be more devastating and permanent than the tragic consequences of hazardous teen driving.

R. Martin&rsquo;s monumental epic cycle of high fantasy. Now, in A Feast for Crows, Martin delivers the long-awaited fourth book of his landmark series, as a kingdom torn asunder finds itself at last on the brink of peace . . . only to be launched on an even more terrifying course of destruction.A FEAST FOR CROWSIt seems too good to be true. After centuries of bitter strife and fatal treachery, the seven powers dividing the land have decimated one another into an uneasy truce. Or so it appears. . . . With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in King&rsquo;s Landing. Robb Stark&rsquo;s demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exist&mdash;or they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so long, has burned itself out. But as in the aftermath of any climactic struggle, it is not long before the survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters start to gather, picking over the bones of the dead and fighting for the spoils of the soon-to-be dead. Now in the Seven Kingdoms, as the human crows assemble over a banquet...",

        "review": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewA Feast for Crows,the long-awaited fourth installment of George R.&nbsp;R. Martin's shelf-splitting A Song of Ice and Fire saga, continues the bloody drama of the war-torn Seven Kingdoms and the battle for the Iron Throne. With the king dead and a child on the throne, Cersei -- the Queen Regent -- must protect her son from myriad enemies vying for control of the realm. As the novel's title implies, although the War of the Five Kings is over, death and destruction are still rampant.Fans of Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire (A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings,andA Storm of Swords) may find this installment a bit unusual -- half the epic's previous plot threads are not even touched upon. Because of the unwieldy size of the finished manuscript (1,500-plus pages), Martin explains his and his publisher's decision to split the book into two volumes: 'It was my feeling that we were better off telling all the story for half the characters, rather than half the story for all the characters. Cutting the novel in half would have produced two half-novels; our approach will produce two novels taking place simultaneously, but set hundreds or even thousands of miles apart, and involving different casts of characters.'Cliffhangers abound in this fourth volume of Martin's spectacularly grandiose narrative -- an epic comparable to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time cycle and Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth saga that features literally hundreds of major characters. (The appendix of dramatis personae is more than 60 pages long!) After finishingA Feast for Crows,fans will be (justifiably) ravenous for the next installment (tentatively titledA Dance with Dragons) to find out what is happening with popular characters not mentioned: namely, Tyrion Lannister, Davos Seaworth, and the enigmatic Mother of Dragons, Daenerys Stormborn.Paul Goat Allen",

In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an 'excitement addict.' Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever.  Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town &#151; and the family &#151; Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home.  What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity.

Decades later, Sylvie has remade herself as the ideal politician&rsquo;s wife&#8212;her hair dyed and straightened, her hippie-chick wardrobe replaced by tailored knit suits. At fifty-seven, she ruefully acknowledges that her job is staying twenty pounds thinner than she was in her twenties and tending to her husband, the senator.Lizzie, the Woodruffs&rsquo; younger daughter, is at twenty-four a recovering addict, whose mantra HALT (Hungry?

The three women's crises function in parallel, and Weiner is unable to keep the narrative tension going when she hops from one character to another, largely because their issues are so tidily resolved and the women are never in real emotional danger--Sylvie's husband's affair is a 'one-day story,' Lizzie's narcotic slip is to take a couple of Advil PM (and an apology resolves the unresolved past), and the breakdown of Diana's marriage is dispatched as easily as Diana making a resolution to change her life. The lack of conflict and strong characters, and the heavy dose of brand names and ripped-from-the-headlines references, make this disappointingly disposable. (July)",

        "description": "'There are three things all wise men fear&#58; the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.' My name is Kvothe. I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. You may have heard of me.  So begins the tale of a hero told from his own point of view-a story unequaled in fantasy literature. Now in The Wise Man's Fear, Day Two of The Kingkiller Chronicle, an escalating rivalry with a powerful member of the nobility forces Kvothe to leave the University and seek his fortune abroad. Adrift, penniless, and alone, he travels to Vintas, where he quickly becomes entangled in the politics of courtly society. While attempting to curry favor with a powerful noble, Kvothe uncovers an assassination attempt, comes into conflict with a rival arcanist, and leads a group of mercenaries into the wild, in an attempt to solve the mystery of who (or what) is waylaying travelers on the King's road. All the while, Kvothe searches for answers, attempting to uncover the truth about the mysterious Amyr, the Chandrian, and the death of his parents. Along the way, Kvothe is put on trial by...",

        "review": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewThe debut novel from Patrick Rothfuss -- the first installment of an epic fantasy trilogy entitled the Kingkiller Chronicle -- not only lives up to its extraordinary pre-press hype (DAW president Elizabeth Wollheim called it 'the most brilliant first fantasy novel I have read in over 30 years as an editor'), it surpasses it. When fantasy fans begin reading The Name of the Wind, they should be fully prepared to lose all contact with the outside world while immersed in this highly original and mesmerizing tale of magic, love, and adventure.The story revolves around Kvothe, an enigmatic red-haired innkeeper who, as he shares his incredible life story with a renowned scribe, turns out to be much more than he appears. Born into a family of nomadic court performers, Kvothe's unconventional education was broadened by spending time with fellow travelers like Abenthy, an elderly arcanist whose knowledge included, among other things, knowing the name of the wind. After his parents are brutally murdered by mythical beings known as the Chandrian, Kvothe vows to learn more about the godlike group, and after suffering through years of homelessness, he finally gets his chance when he is admitted into the prestigious University. But the pursuit of arcane knowledge brings with it unforeseen dangers, as the young student quickly learnsWith the release of his first novel, Rothfuss (who has already been compared to the likes of Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, and George R.&nbsp;R. Martin) is poised to be crowned the new king of epic fantasy. The Name of the Wind won't just impress longtime fantasy fans; it will absolutely blow them away -- an unprecedented, utterly breathtaking storytelling tour de force.Paul Goat Allen",

But it is not just the buildings that are beautiful: Italy's landscapes&#151;high mountains, rolling hills and valleys, and sun-washed coasts have inspired generations. Italians seem to have an innate feeling for color and design, and when you study their countryside it comes as no surprise that so many of the world's greatest artists, poets, and musicians came from this wonderful land.After a short introduction, Italy: Landscape and History divides the country into sections on:Rome and LazioVenice and the NortheastFlorence and TuscanyMilan, Lombardy, and the AlpsBolzano and the DolomitesPerugia and UmbriaLe Marche, the Apennines, and the Adriatic CoastTurin and PiedmontGenoa and the Italian RivieraNaples and the Amalfi CoastBari and the SouthPalermo and SicilyCagliari and SardiniaEach section gives a flavor of the area, its countryside and historic buildings, from the snowy Alps of the north, through the magical atmosphere of Venice and the Veneto, romantic Tuscany, and central Italy&#151;Perugia...",

Whether it's classics like Pesto, fried calamari, and braciole, or comfort food like slow-cooked Chicken Cacciatore served over creamy polenta, Giudice's recipes and instructions ensure quality every time. Some may balk at making fresh pasta for dishes like Franco's Fettuccine with Creamy Portobello Sauce, not to mention their own foccacia for sandwiches, but those who do roll up their sleeves should find Giudice's tutelage useful. Though the recipes don't feel rushed, much of the book, padded with images and stories of Saturday morning pancake breakfasts, does. A startling number of pages are devoted to glossy photos, seemingly from the same day, of family members in varying combinations. When a particular recipe is featured, it is often given two pages (recipe; picture). Traditionalists in search of a collection of classic recipes will appreciate Giudice's aversion to corner-cutting, and her calorie-cutting tips, and fans of The Real Housewives will lap it all up. Those searching for a more expansive take on Italian cuisine, however, will feel cheated.(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.  All rights reserved.",

But that was before the crazy hacker caused all their feeds to malfunction, sending them to the hospital to lie around with nothing inside their heads for days. And it was before Titus met Violet, a beautiful, brainy girl who has decided to fight the feed and its omnipresent ability to categorize human thoughts and desires. Following in the footsteps of George Orwell, Anthony Burgess, and Kurt Vonnegut Jr., National Book Award winner M. T.

Elend Venture, the scholarly new Lord Ruler of Luthadel, clings to power while Luthadel's aristocrats and merchants grumble and two enemy armies-one led by Elend's father, Lord Straff-camp outside the city gates. Fortunately, Elend can rely on help from his lover and unofficial court assassin, the young allomancer Vin, but her magical metal-using ability makes her a target. An orphan of decidedly low origins, Vin is also having trouble adapting to her position as royal consort, especially since the underclass skaa, newly freed by Elend, look to her as their protector. Meanwhile, the ancient evil known as the Deepness is rising once again. This entertaining read will especially please those who always wanted to know what happened after the good guys won.(Aug.)Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information",

But as a result, the Deepness&#151;-the lethal form of the ubiquitous mists&#151;-is back, along with increasingly heavy ashfalls and ever more powerful earthquakes. Humanity appears to be doomed.Having escaped death at the climax ofThe Well of Ascensiononly by becoming a Mistborn himself, Emperor Elend Venture hopes to find clues left behind by the Lord Ruler that will allow him to save the world. Vin is consumed with guilt at having been tricked into releasing the mystic force known as Ruin from the Well. Ruin wants to end the world, and its near omniscience and ability to warp reality make stopping it seem impossible. She can&#8217;t even discuss it with Elend lest Ruin learn their plans!The conclusion of the Mistborn trilogy fulfills all the promise of the first two books. Revelations abound, connections rooted in early chapters of the series click into place, and surprises, as satisfying as they are stunning, blossom like fireworks to dazzle and delight. It all leads up to a finale unmatched for originality and audacity that will leave readers rubbing their eyes in wonder, as if awaking from an amazing dream.",

The reign of the newly self-appointed King Yeslnik is already distinguished as the most bloody and merciless in Honce history.Trapped, Dame Gwydre and Father Artolivan concoct a desperate plot to join forces with Laird Ethelbert, the lesser of two vicious evils. But Ethelbert&#8217;s paid assassins slew Jameston Sequin and nearly did the same to Bransen.&#160;Embittered by it all, Bransen&#160;seeks to extricate himself from the selfish goals of all of combatants. But in an odd twist of fate and crossed loyalties, Bransen sees in his old nemesis, Bannagran&#151;the Bear of Honce and the man who slew his adoptive father - a darker image of his own heart. Allies and battle lines become tangled, motives indistinguishable as old friends become enemies and old enemies become allies.",

        "review": "Epic fantasy heavyweight Sanderson (the Mistborn series) pens a powerful stand-alone tale of unpredictable loyalties, dark intrigue and dangerous magic. To keep a treaty made long ago, the king of Idris must send his daughter to marry Susebron, the God King of Hallandren. Loath to part with his eldest daughter, Vivenna, King Dedelin instead sends his youngest daughter, tomboyish 17-year-old Siri, who struggles to make sense of the schemers and spies in Susebron's court. Hoping to rescue her sister, Vivenna joins a group of Idrian operatives with questionable motives. As Vivenna comes to terms with her magical abilities, resurrected hero Lightsong questions the role of the undead Returned Gods, who command Hallandren's mighty army of zombie soldiers. Sanderson melds complex, believable characters, a marvelous world and thoughtful, ironic humor into an extraordinary and highly entertaining story.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Told in a touching, doggy first-person, this unabashedly sentimental tale introduces Toby, who's rescued by a woman without a license for her rescue operation, so, sadly, Toby ends up euthanized. He's reborn in a puppy mill and after almost dying while left in a hot car, he's saved again by a woman, and he becomes Bailey, a beloved golden retriever, who finds happiness and many adventures. His next intense incarnation is as Ellie, a female German shepherd, a heroic search and rescue dog. But the true purpose of this dog's life doesn't become totally clear until his reincarnation as Buddy, a black Lab. A book for all age groups who admire canine courage, Cameron also successfully captures the essence of a dog's amazing capacity to love and protect. And happily, unlike Marley, this dog stays around for the long haul. (July)",

Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut&#8212;young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity.

His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister.Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long.

        "review": "This twenty-five-year-old science fiction classic has been repackaged for younger readers. Unlike many hard-core science fiction titles, this book is particularly appropriate for a younger audience, for its protagonist, Ender Wiggin, is just six years old at the novel's beginning and still a pre-teen at its end. Ender's parents have received a special dispensation to have a third child in spite of strict population control laws. His brilliant older siblings, Peter and Valentine, have each showed great promise, but each falls just short of having 'the right stuff.' The International Fleet (I.F.) believes that Ender may be the commander they need to lead great armies against invasion by alien 'buggers.' When Ender does exhibit the desired combination of compassion and cruelty, the I.F. takes him to the distant Battle School, where brilliant children are trained in military strategy and tactics. The centerpiece of their education is a simulated battle game at which Ender quickly excels, eventually becoming the youngest commander in history. Life at Battle School, especially these battle games, is richly described. Ender is portrayed as just a pawn in the larger game being played by the I.F., and readers will alternately sympathize with his exploitation and cheer when he is able to make friends in spite of the tremendous forces working to isolate and dehumanize him. The political and philosophical material at the novel's end may get too heavy for some readers, but for the most part, this novel will deservedly reach a new generation through this new edition.",

(The first volume of the Sword of Truth,Wizard's First Rule,was released in 1994.)As the Seeker of Truth Richard Rahl continues to look for his wife, Kahlan, and somehow free her from the Chainfire spell -- which, in essence, has made her invisible to those around her and has erased her from the memories of everyone who knew her -- she is unwillingly traveling with three malevolent Sisters of the Dark en route to a destiny that has the potential 'to unravel the world itself.' On his quest, however, Richard is forced to accept some grim realizations: As he is chasing a phantom and trying to save one person, the rest of the world is descending into unimaginable horror. Emperor Jagang and the sadistic Imperial Order forces are on the verge of subjugating the entire New World and the powerful magic that once flowed across the realm has been tainted and is corrupting everything it comes in contact with. 'It's as if all that was this world is passing into a realm of mere legend 'One of the most ambitious fantasy sagas ever undertaken,Phantomincludes bombshells that will have Sword of Truth fans practically climbing the walls in anticipation for the 11th and final volume.

Now comes the mouthwatering three-course meal -- the much-expanded version about the prophecy that started it all.Set approximately two decades before the events of the first book in the series, the story focuses on two characters: Lan Mandragoran, the uncrowned warrior king of a nation that no longer exists, and Moiraine Damodred, a young Accepted soon to become an Aes Sedai (one of an elite group of powerful and often dangerous women who can channel the One Power). As Lan and his fellow soldiers drive the invading clans of black-veiled Aiel back across the Spine of the World, a blood-chilling prophecy is foretold by a dying Aes Sedai. 'He is born again! The Dragon takes his first breath on the slopes of Dragonmount! He is coming! Light help us! Light help the world!' The birth of this child is both terrifying and wondrous in its implications. The birth means the Dark One will break free again, for the child is fated to face the Dark One in Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle. He could save the world -- or destroy it forever.Although Wheel of Time followers will undoubtedly make this novel an international bestseller, the appeal ofNew Springis even wider in scope because of its status as the prequel to one of the bestselling fantasy series of all time. This is not only a must-read book for longtime fans of the saga but also a perfect place for new fans to begin their epic literary journey on the ever turning Wheel of Time.Paul Goat Allen",

The destinies of these four, particularly of Ash and Raif, become progressively entwined, even entangled, as the novel lumbers toward its inconclusive ending. Throughout, Jones skillfully mixes bits borrowed from history, folklore, religion (her shamans are particularly well done) and other fantasy works, but her attention to these details and her determination to introduce every element of her trilogy at once slow the pacing and sometimes create more confusion than clarity. Nonetheless, Jones has a real gift for evocative description, and the novel will satisfy most saga lovers. Agent, Russ Galen.",

        "review": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewBrandon Sanderson's debut novel,Elantris-- an instant fantasy classic about a fallen city of the gods and its inexplicable rise from its own ruins -- is a singular storytelling tour de force that is absolutely beyond compare.The city of Elantris was once the most beautiful in the world. Inhabited by a godlike populace and home to innumerable wonders, it attracted people from far and wide. But then something happened. The magic that powered Elantris suddenly disappeared. The once-radiant Elantrians became leprous creatures, and the city fell into shadow.Ten years after the Punishment, Elantris is a ghost town, a 'land of sludge, insanity, and eternal perdition,' inhabited by those few who become afflicted with the Shaod, a dread disease that blackens the skin, stops the heart, and suspends those ill-fated souls in a state of nightmarish half death. Raoden, the beloved crown prince of Arelon, contracts the ailment just as he prepares for his wedding to Princess Sarene of Teod. He is secretly whisked away to Elantris, where King Iadon informs his people that his son has died of an 'unexpected disease.' Sarene arrives shortly thereafter, finding a kingdom on the verge of collapse. In the shadow of the ghostly city, Sarene vows to do what she can to stop the religious and political upheaval. Raoden, meanwhile, uncovers the jaw-dropping secrets of Elantris.In a genre where mainstream success regularly leads to mind-numbing repetition (unnecessarily prolonged series that recycle predictable plotlines) and shameless mass imitation, true creative genius is often hard to find. Fantasy fans need not look any further for such genius -- Brandon Sanderson is his name, andElantrisis his calling card.Paul Goat Allen",

But as a result, the Deepness&#151;-the lethal form of the ubiquitous mists&#151;-is back, along with increasingly heavy ashfalls and ever more powerful earthquakes. Humanity appears to be doomed.Having escaped death at the climax ofThe Well of Ascensiononly by becoming a Mistborn himself, Emperor Elend Venture hopes to find clues left behind by the Lord Ruler that will allow him to save the world. Vin is consumed with guilt at having been tricked into releasing the mystic force known as Ruin from the Well. Ruin wants to end the world, and its near omniscience and ability to warp reality make stopping it seem impossible. She can&#8217;t even discuss it with Elend lest Ruin learn their plans!The conclusion of the Mistborn trilogy fulfills all the promise of the first two books. Revelations abound, connections rooted in early chapters of the series click into place, and surprises, as satisfying as they are stunning, blossom like fireworks to dazzle and delight. It all leads up to a finale unmatched for originality and audacity that will leave readers rubbing their eyes in wonder, as if awaking from an amazing dream.",

Tricked into releasing the evil spirit Ruin while attempting to close the Well of Ascension, new emperor Elend Venture and his wife, the assassin Vin, are now hard-pressed to save the world from Ruin's deadly Inquisitors, the insidious lethal mists called the Deepness and the increasingly heavy falls of black ash that threaten to bury the land and starve its inhabitants. As the duo search for the last of the former emperor's cache of atium, source of the strongest Mistborn energies, they battle Ruin's forces as well as monsters and prophetic powers.

Since Homer first sang the wrath of Achilles and the ancient Sumerians set down their tales of Gilgamesh, warriors, soldiers, and fighters have fascinated us; they are a part of every culture, every literary tradition, every genre. All Quiet on the Western Front, From Here to Eternity, and The Red Badge of Courage have become part of our literary canon, taught in classrooms all around the country and the world. Our contributors make up an all-star lineup of award-winning and bestselling writers, representing a dozen different publishers and as many genres. We asked each of them for the same thing&#8212;a story about a warrior. Some chose to write in the genre they&#8217;re best known for. Some decided to try something different. You will find warriors of every shape, size, and color in these pages, warriors from every epoch of human history, from yesterday and today and tomorrow, and from worlds that never were.

The result is an unpredictable assortment, where SF and fantasy rub elbows with mystery, historical, and military fiction, and even a western. The Vikings of Cecilia Holland&rsquo;s &ldquo;The King of Norway,&rdquo; the secret community in Howard Waldrop&rsquo;s WWI tale, &ldquo;Ninieslando,&rdquo; and the rogue AIs in Dozois&rsquo;s own &ldquo;Recidivist&rdquo; provide a little something for everyone. Urban fantasy author Carrie Vaughn turns in &ldquo;The Girls from Avenger,&rdquo; a straight historical piece about female WWII pilots, while historical fantasist Naomi Novik&rsquo;s &ldquo;Seven Years from Home&rdquo; is pure SF. There are a few clunkers, but on the whole, the editors succeed admirably in their mission to break down genre barriers and focus on pure entertainment. (Mar.)",

Before he can show them to Nicholas Brisbane, the private inquiry agent he has retained for his protection, Sir Edward collapses and dies at his London home, in the presence of his wife, Julia, and a roomful of dinner guests.Prepared to accept that Edward's death was due to a long-standing physical infirmity, Julia is outraged when Brisbane visits and suggests that Sir Edward has been murdered. It is a reaction she comes to regret when she discovers the damning paper for herself, and realizes the truth.Determined to bring her husband's murderer to justice, Julia engages the enigmatic Brisbane to help her investigate Edward's demise. Dismissing his warnings that the investigation will be difficult, if not impossible, Julia presses forward, following a trail of clues that lead her to even more unpleasant truths, and ever closer to a killer who waits expectantly for her arrival.",

In 1886, Lady Julia Grey's husband,  Edward, dies suddenly of the heart disease that plagues his  family, including his reclusive cousin, Simon, who resides with  the couple in their large London townhouse. Just as she learns  to cope with the contradictions of monied widowhood, Julia is  visited by taciturn private detective Nicholas Brisbane, who  reveals that Edward had hired him to find the source of some  threatening letters. Analysis confirms Brisbane's suspicions of  murder, leading him and Julia on a testily collaborative search  for the culprit. Julia probes servants, Simon and a variety of  peers, discovering disturbing truths about a husband she never  truly knew and a world of deception, disease and sexual  obsession she could never have imagined. Deft historical  detailing, sparkling first-person narration and the fledgling  love between Julia and the often surprising Brisbane balance  otherwise dark themes. None of the book's components is new, but  Raybourn updates and deepens them so intelligently that they  feel freshly minted and free of clich . (Jan.)   Copyright 2006 Reed Business Information.",

Frankie starts her sophomore year with elevated social status thanks to having become the main squeeze of Big Man on Campus Matthew Livingston, but confides her conflicted feelings about being 'arm candy' to roommate Trish, who responds with sweet but Valley Girl-esque befuddlement befitting someone who stays home making fruit crumbles while the boys go out partying. Sirois goes to a deeper register for heartthrob Matthew, leader of the Loyal Order of the Basset Hounds, an all-male secret society Frankie plots to infiltrate, and affects a surfer-dude patois for Alpha, Matthew's sidekick. Sirois preserves the fun in Lockhart's talky novel, largely fueled by the intelligent repartee among its principals.

Salvatore's Forgotten Realm's novels, is back and badder than ever inThe Lone Drow,the second book in Salvatore's Hunter's Blades trilogy.InA Thousand Orcs,the first book in the trilogy, an army of orcs and frost giants have joined forces and overrun an important dwarven stronghold. The monstrous fighting force is led by King Obould Many-Arrows, a hulking orc with something most orcs are lacking -- intelligence. During the terrible orc onslaught, one of Drizzt's close friends (and there aren't many of them!), the legendary dwarf King Breunor Battlehammer, is lost as a tower collapses. Drizzt can only watch as his friend falls to what must surely be his deathInThe Lone Drow,Obould Many-Arrows and his evil minions are systematically closing in on Mithral Hall. When the orc priests declare Obould to be the living personification of their god, religious fanaticism reaches a frenzy and the slaughter reaches new levels. With orcs and giants on all sides and trolls in the tunnels, the future looks bleak for Drizzt's companions and all the dwarves inside the great hall. But the dwarf king Breunor isn't quite dead, and Drizzt stalks the orcs in the wilderness like a black-skinned madman, wielding two razor-sharp scimitars. Will it be enough to stop the approaching army?It doesn't matter if you're a teenager or an octogenarian; Salvatore's Forgotten Realms novels are guaranteed to be addictively entertaining. Great characters, complex story lines, nonstop action, and breathtaking locations -- this is adventure fantasy at its very best.Paul Goat Allen",

Now out in paperback, Matterhorn is an epic war novel in the tradition of Norman Mailer&#8217;s The Naked and the Dead and James Jones&#8217;s The Thin Red Line. It is the timeless story of a young Marine lieutenant, Waino Mellas, and his comrades in Bravo Company, who are dropped into the mountain jungle of Vietnam as boys and forced to fight their way into manhood. Standing in their way are not merely the North Vietnamese but also monsoon rain and mud, leeches and tigers, disease and malnutrition. Almost as daunting, it turns out, are the obstacles they discover between each other&#58; racial tension, competing ambitions, and duplicitous superior officers. But when the company finds itself surrounded and outnumbered by a massive enemy regiment, the Marines are thrust into the raw and all-consuming terror of combat. The experience will change them forever.Matterhorn is a visceral and spellbinding novel about what it is like to be a young man at war. It is an unforgettable novel that transforms the tragedy of Vietnam into a powerful and universal story of courage, camaraderie, and sacrifice&#58; a parable...",

        "review": "From his earliest days on the ground, Lieutenant Waino Mellas &#151;\r\nPrinceton educated, fresh, green, and uneasy in his new fatigues &#151; has\r\nsecond-guessed his decision to become a marine. Yet here he is, an officer\r\nleading a rifle platoon in a desolate corner of South Vietnam. The men in\r\nMarlantes's gut-wrenching first novel &#151; young, raw, and far from home\r\n&#151; are facing the toughest trial by fire imaginable. Dumped on a jungle\r\nhilltop that's shrouded in monsoon rains and clouds, they're too crippled\r\nby fatigue, boredom, and the dearth of supplies to question policy. Like\r\nmost soldiers, they follow orders whether they make sense or not, in a\r\nwar too complex for them to figure out.Authentic and unflinching, with dialogue so vivid it plunges readers\r\nsquarely into the inferno of war,Matterhornis both white-knuckled\r\nadventure and superb literature. From the smallest details &#151; the music,\r\nthe gear, and the C rations; the smells, the heat, and the humidity &#151; to\r\nthe most profound judgments made high up the chain of command, it's a\r\ntour de force of storytelling. A celebration of the courage and camaraderie\r\nof our young men in uniform, and a chilling indictment of the politics of\r\nwar,Matterhornis an unforgettable and vital testament that keeps alive\r\nthe thousands of stories of heroism during what some might consider one\r\nof history's darkest and most regrettable moments.",

        "review": "Seventeen-year-old Carlos has moved around a lot in his life. He grew up in Chicago, but when his brother got involved with gangs, his mother moved the family, sans father, to Mexico. Now Carlos finds himself on his way to Colorado to live with his brother (now reformed and in college) and attend his last year of high school. He is resentful, handsome and cocky, and he has no plans to abide by anyone's rules. One of the first people he meets is Kiara, an honor student who has been assigned to escort him around school for the first few days. Carlos is dealing with his past, his current reputation, getting reacquainted with his brother, and the complex social situation at school. Kiara is dealing with her stuttering problem and her own place in the social system at school. She was recently dumped by a boyfriend via text message. Feeling like he doesn't need a babysitter, Carlos blows her off; with her retaliation, sparks fly as two opposite poles of a magnet begin to attract each other. The story is told in their alternating voices, and the final outcome is as predictable as a Harlequin romance novel (especially since this book belongs to 'A Perfect Chemistry' series). Nevertheless, it is an entertaining read while still being deep enough and well characterized enough to make the two protagonists interesting as they dance towards, away and then back to each through its pages.

        "review": "Beautiful, wealthy Brittany is a popular diva, so when she and Alex, a tough Hispanic gang member, become chemistry partners uneasiness reigns. Defenses fall, however, revealing Brittany's fractured parents, her sister Shelley's severe cerebral palsy, and her struggle for perfection that is guilty atonement for being healthy. Alex is intelligent, kind, and longs for college; gang membership exempts his brothers' joining and promises their better future. They surreptitiously begin a relationship with Brittany dumping her diva crowd while demanding family counseling. Alex chooses the dangerous rite of leaving his gang and works to rebuild his shaky family. When Shelley enters a Colorado facility, Brittany accompanies her and enrolls in college as a chemistry major, but Alex arrives soon after with a proposal. The epilogue announces their groundbreaking Alzheimer's drug and portrays their son meeting his beloved in their former chemistry class. Alternately narrated by Brittany and Alex, this compelling story portrays complex teens whose manufactured personas hide personal problems. Their contradictory lives and reactions to each other's provide conflicts and character insights, but once their romance begins they and the narration unravel. The story becomes overlong and repetitive with the duo's edginess dissolving into contrivances and sappiness, full of convenient and largely improbable events. The sultry cover should attract many female readers but will keep mainly those enjoying star-crossed romances. Reviewer: Lisa A. Hazlett",

During his time onThe West Wing, he witnessed the surreal nexus of show business and politics both on the set and in the actual White House. And in between are deft and humorous stories of the wild excesses that marked the eighties, leading to his quest for family and sobriety.Never mean-spirited or salacious, Lowe delivers unexpected glimpses into his successes, disappointments, relationships, and one-of-a-kind encounters with people who shaped our world over the last twenty-five years. These stories are as entertaining as they are unforgettable.",

With 116 million albums sold worldwide and 25 years on the pop charts to their credit, Pink Floyd is one of the most successful rock groups in history, yet their story until now is one of the least known. The only continuous member of the band through its entire 40-year history, Nick Mason has witnessed every twist, turn, and sommersault from behind his drum kit. The journey begins with the band's origins as the darlings of London's late 1960s underground and the creation of the classic Pink Floyd sound, all the way through to The Wall and those legendary stadium shows. Here are the players who shaped the band's history and the story behind the story the inside perspective on, for example, the deterioration and departure of Syd Barrett; the overwhelming success of The Dark Side of the Moon and the resulting pressures and conflicts within the band, including the rift with Roger Waters; and Nick and David Gilmour's decision to put their reputations on the line and continue as Pink Floyd. Packed with rare photographs and vintage Floyd graphics from Nick Mason's extensive private archive, Inside Out is an eye-opener for both veteran fans and those just discovering the group. And, in keeping with the classic Floyd style, the book's cover was designed by Storm Thorgerson, creator of such iconic images as the Dark Side pyramid. Always candid, by turns poignant and funny, Nick's own memories...",

He is probably best known, however, as the drummer of  the famed rock band Pink Floyd, the only original member with  the group throughout its 40-year existence. Here, he offers a  masterly chronicle of Pink Floyd's formation, recording and  concert career, and eventual breakup, revealing rare insights  into the band's interpersonal conflicts (including the departure  of Syd Barrett), songwriting and recording techniques, and  massive tours. Adorning the text are rare and often previously  unpublished photographs and illustrations from Mason's private  archive. This marks the first time a founding member of the band  has shared his story; it supplants Nicholas Schaffner's classic  Saucerful of Secrets (1991).

Once a simple woods guide, Richard was forced to become the Seeker of Truth, to save the world from the vile dominance of Darken Rahl, the most viciously savage and powerful wizard the world had ever seen. He was joined on this epic quest by his beloved Kahlan, the only survivor among the Confessors, who brought a powerful but benevolent justice to the land before Rahl's evil scourge. Aided by Zedd, the last of the wizards who opposed Rahl, they were able to cast him into the underworld, saving the world from the living hell of life under Rahl.But the veil to the underworld has been torn, and Rahl, from beyond the veil, begins to summon a sinister power more dreadful than any he has wielded before. Horrifying creatures escape through the torn veil, wreaking havoc on the unsuspecting world above.If Rahl isn't stopped, he will free the Keeper itself, an evil entity whose power is so vast and foul that once freed, it can never again be contained.",

Now her pack leaders are sending her back to live among the humans, as they promised her mother years ago.Some of the humans think she may be the lost heir to their throne. This could be good-and it could be very, very dangerous. In the months to come, learning to behave like a human will turn out to be more complicated than she'd ever imagined.But though human ways might be stranger than anything found in the forest, the infighting in the human's pack is nothing Firekeeper hasn't seen before. That, she understands just fine. She's not your standard-issue princess-and this is not your standard-issue fairy tale.",

Lindskold went on to create novels in her own right, and this effort could be described as a historic fantasy with touches of romance, intrigue, and myth. The story centers on Firekeeper, a teenage orphan who has been living in the wilderness with a pack of giant, intelligent wolves. Her world is turned upside down when an expedition arrives looking for the long-lost Prince Barden and his group. The girl, who can 'climb like a squirrel, swim like a fish and outrun a trotting horse,' knows that she must confront the humans to find out more about her mysterious past. After meeting the group, it is speculated that this wild child could be the heir to the throne of Hawk Haven.",

But Rand dares not fight until he possesses all the surviving seals on the Dark One&#8217;s prison and has dealt with the Seanchan, who threaten to overrun all nations this side of the Aryth Ocean and increasingly seem too entrenched to be fought off. But his attempt to make a truce with the Seanchan is shadowed by treachery that may cost him everything. Whatever the price, though, he must have that truce. And he faces other dangers.

A desperate Perrin Aybara is also dealing with the treacherous Seanchan, willing to do whatever it takes to finally rescue his wife from slavery. Mat Cauthon, meanwhile, has his hands full with the kidnapped Seanchan princess Tuon, whose ingenious plans have put Mat in a completely unexpected position. And as long-standing traditions and alliances crumble, the Forsaken prepare to compel the world into ShadowWhile few science fiction/fantasy works deserve to be read multiple times -- Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Herbert's Dune sequence, et al. -- Jordan's Wheel of Time cycle is one of those extremely rare sagas that is so dense, so packed with substance, that it's almost essential to read the novels more than once. Colossal, massive, gargantuan: Everything about Wheel of Time is epic -- the dozens of interweaving plotlines, the hundreds of integral characters, the extensive histories of the realm, the vast settings, etc. But after 11 shelf-bending volumes -- as Tarmon Gai'don looms -- fans can find solace in the thought that after the final installment is released, they can go back to the beginning (The Eye of the World) and start this once-in-a-lifetime fantasy masterpiece all over again. After all:  There are neither beginnings nor endings in the Wheel of TimePaul Goat Allen",

Here, 16 scholars set delve into the heart of Pink Floyd by examining ideas, concepts, and problems usually encountered not in a rock band's lyrics but in the pages of Heidegger, Foucault, and Sartre. These include the meaning of existence, the individual's place in society, the contradictions of art and commerce, and the blurry line between genius and madness. The band&#8217;s dynamic history allows the writers to explore controversies about intellectual property, the nature of authorship, and whether wholes, especially in the case of rock bands, are more than the sum of their parts.",

Among them is Major Ernest Pettigrew (retired), the unlikely hero of Helen Simonson's wondrous debut. Wry, courtly, opinionated, and completely endearing, Major Pettigrew is one of the most indelible characters in contemporary fiction, and from the very first page of this remarkable novel he will steal your heart.The Major leads a quiet life valuing the proper things that Englishmen have lived by for generations&#58; honor, duty, decorum, and a properly brewed cup of tea. But then his brother's death sparks an unexpected friendship with Mrs. Jasmina Ali, the Pakistani shopkeeper from the village. Drawn together by their shared love of literature and the loss of their respective spouses, the Major and Mrs. Ali soon find their friendship blossoming into something more. But village society insists on embracing him as the quintessential local and her as the permanent foreigner. Can their relationship survive the risks one takes when pursuing happiness in the face of culture and tradition?",

        "review": "Major Ernest Pettigrew, retired, of Edgecombe St. Mary, England, is more\r\nthan a little dismayed by the sloppy manners, narcissism, and materialism\r\nof modern society. The decline of gentility is evident everywhere, from tea\r\nbags, to designer sweaters, to racism masquerading as tolerance.Mutual grief allies him with Mrs. Ali, a widowed local shopkeeper of\r\nPakistani descent who has also resigned herself to dignified, if solitary, last\r\nyears. The carefully suppressed passion between these two spawns twitters\r\nof disapproval in their provincial village, but Pettigrew hasn't time for such\r\nsilliness: real estate developers are plotting to carpet the fields outside his\r\nback door with mansionettes and his sister-in-law plans to auction off a\r\nprized family firearm. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ali's late husband's Muslim family\r\nexpects her to hand over her hard-won business to her sullen, fundamentalist\r\nnephew, a notion she finds repellant and chauvinistic.It's a testament to Simonson that in this delightful novel, Pettigrew\r\nmust navigate the tragic, the absurd, and the transcendentally joyful\r\naspects of a familiar life turned upside down by an unfamiliar and unexpected\r\nlate-life love affair. That two people from opposing and mutually\r\ndistrusting worlds are able to bridge every gap with unerring respect and\r\ndecorum serves as a quiet suggestion that larger conflicts might be avoided\r\nor resolved in much the same way. Finally, a way forward that Major\r\nPettigrew would approve.",

She has nothing but time now, as she recounts the tale of Snow Flower, and asks the gods for forgiveness.In nineteenth-century China, when wives and daughters were foot-bound and lived in almost total seclusion, the women in one remote Hunan county developed their own secret code for communication&#58; nu shu (&#8220;women&#8217;s writing&#8221;). Some girls were paired with laotongs, &#8220;old sames,&#8221; in emotional matches that lasted throughout their lives. They painted letters on fans, embroidered messages on handkerchiefs, and composed stories, thereby reaching out of their isolation to share their hopes, dreams, and accomplishments.With the arrival of a silk fan on which Snow Flower has composed for Lily a poem of introduction in nu shu, their friendship is sealed and they become &#8220;old sames&#8221; at the tender age of seven. As the years pass, through famine and rebellion, they reflect upon their arranged marriages, loneliness, and the joys and tragedies of motherhood. The two find solace, developing a bond that keeps their spirits alive. But when a misunderstanding arises, their lifelong friendship suddenly threatens to tear apart.Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is a brilliantly realistic journey back to an era of Chinese history that is as deeply moving as it is sorrowful.

Health Magazine, the expert when it comes to healthy living, takes this revolutionary new science and turns it into an easy-to-follow, real women-tested, dietitian-approved road map proven to melt off 10, 35, even 100 plus pounds forever. Our test kitchen chefs and registered dietitians also developed 85 delicious, simple recipes and foolproof meal plans that help you lose weight while you enjoy the foods you've craved for years.

In this revision of his 1986 book, he describes the 'E-Myth,' which basically states that a person with technical but few management skills can do well in business. Gerber describes developing a precise business system that produces consistent results because it has been tested and refined. He says that businesses thrive because of innovation, quantification, and orchestration. Visualize what is true success to you as a person, Gerber advises, and work from the ideal to the specific. While the author is a consumate salesman who reads his material in soothing tones, he offers too many abstract ideas and too few concrete plans.

Yet brain scientists have uncovered details every business leader, parent, and teacher should know-such as the brain's need for physical activity to work at its best.How do we learn? What exactly do sleep and stress do to our brains? Why is multi-tasking a myth? Why is it so easy to forget-and so important to repeat new knowledge? Is it true that men and women have different brains?In Brain Rules, molecular biologist Dr. John Medina shares his lifelong interest in how the brain sciences might influence the way we teach our children and the way we work. In each chapter, he describes a Brain Rule-what scientists know for sure about how our brains work-and then offers transformative ideas for our daily lives.Medina's fascinating stories and sense of humor breathe life into brain science. You'll learn why Michael Jordan was no good at baseball. You'll peer over a surgeon's shoulder as he finds, to his surprise, that we have a Jennifer Aniston neuron. You'll meet a boy who has an amazing memory for music but can't tie his own shoes.You will discover how:  Exercise improves cognition  Every brain is wired differently  We are designed never to stop learning and exploring  Memories are volatile and susceptible to corruption  Sleep is powerfully linked with the ability to learn  Vision trumps all of the other senses  Stress changes the way we learnIn...",

Just as French Impressionists upended centuries of tradition, Modernist cuisine has in recent years blown through the boundaries of the culinary arts. Borrowing techniques from the laboratory, pioneering chefs at world-renowned restaurants such as elBulli, The Fat Duck, Alinea, and wd~50 have incorporated a deeper understanding of science and advances in cooking technology into their culinary art.In Modernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking, Nathan Myhrvold, Chris Young, and Maxime Bilet scientists, inventors, and accomplished cooks in their own right have created a six-volume 2,400-page set that reveals science-inspired techniques for preparing food that ranges from the otherworldly to the sublime. The authors and their 20-person team at The Cooking Lab have achieved astounding new flavors and textures by using tools such as water baths, homogenizers, centrifuges, and ingredients such as hydrocolloids, emulsifiers, and enzymes. It is a work destined to reinvent cooking.How do you make an omelet light and tender on the outside, but rich and creamy inside? Or French fries with a light and fluffy interior and a delicate, crisp crust that doesn t go soggy? Imagine being able to encase a mussel in a gelled sphere of its own sweet and briny juice. Or to create a silky-smooth pistachio cream made from nothing more than the nuts themselves. Modernist Cuisine offers step-by-step, illustrated instructions, as well...",

Ina has taken their cue and assembled a collection of easy recipes inspired by classic French favorites in BAREFOOT IN PARIS.Although she lives in New York, Ina admits that her heart belongs to Paris. After all, what's more enticing than sipping caf\u00e9 au lait and nibbling a warm brioche at a sidewalk table along the bustling Saint Germain? Or strolling through the city's open-air markets in search of the perfect fromage for an easy weeknight souffl\u00e9? For Ina, these simple pleasures of Paris life translate into one cardinal rule of cooking: fresh, quality ingredients are the essence of good food. This is not elaborate haute cuisine \u00e0 la Julia Child, but casual French fare that makes sense in American kitchens.As with her previous cookbooks, Ina's BAREFOOT IN PARIS features traditional dishes with a distinct brand of simple elegance. Her Raspberry Tart is made with a buttery shortbread crust that's just as delicious but far easier to prepare than a delicate pastry shell. She gives Mocha Mousse a kick of orange for more depth. The inspiration is undoubtedly French, but the downhome recipes like Zucchini Vichyssoise, Sweet Potato Gratin, and Vanilla Pound Cake are uniquely...",

On the surface, this short-lived African American Virginian seems an unlikely candidate for immortality. The most remarkable thing about her, some might argue, is that she had ten children during her thirty-one years on earth. Actually, we all owe Ms. Lacks a great debt and some of us owe her our lives. As Rebecca Skloot tells us in this riveting human story, Henrietta was the involuntary donor of cells from her cancerous tumors that have been cultured to create an immortal cell line for medical research. These so-called HeLa cells have not only generated billions of dollars for the medical industry; they have helped uncover secrets of cancers, viruses, fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping.

And here, in her long-awaited first book, she does the same-helps you put a fabulous dinner on the table tonight, for friends or just for the kids, with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of flavor. She makes it all look easy, because it is. Everyday Italian is true to its title: the fresh, simple recipes are incredibly quick and accessible, and also utterly mouth-watering-perfect for everyday cooking.

In Barefoot Contessa at Home, Ina shares her life in East Hampton, the recipes she loves, and her secrets to making guests feel welcome and comfortable.For Ina, it&#8217;s friends and family&#8211;gathered around the dinner table or cooking with her in the kitchen&#8211;that really make her house feel like home. Here Ina offers the tried-and-true recipes that she makes over and over again because they&#8217;re easy, they work, and they&#8217;re universally loved.

For lunch, she has classics with a twist, such as Tomato, Mozzarella, and Pesto Paninis and Old-Fashioned Potato Salad, which are simply delicious. Then there are Ina&#8217;s homey dinners&#8211;from her own version of loin of pork stuffed with saut&#233;ed fennel to the exotic flavors of Eli&#8217;s Asian Salmon. And since Ina knows no one ever forgets what you serve for dessert, she includes recipes for outrageously luscious sweets like Peach and Blueberry Crumble, Pumpkin Mousse Parfait, and Chocolate Cupcakes with Peanut Butter Icing.Ina also lets readers in on her time-tested...",

        "review": "The sixth cookbook from the Barefoot Contessa juggernaut contains exactly the kind of appealing, simple-yet-just-gourmet-enough recipes Garten devotees adore. There's nothing very surprising (Garten tries to claim an ingredient-focused premise), but her formula works. She offers such dishes as Lobster Corn Chowder, Creamy Cucumber Salad, Tuscan Lemon Chicken, Tagliarelle with Truffle Butter (which has just five ingredients, plus salt and pepper), and Brownie Pudding. Garten suggests tips on such things as setting the table and '10 things not to serve at a dinner party.' Her tone can be charmingly pretentious, but she comes down to earth with admissions like 'I have to admit that pastry still makes me anxious. When I discovered puff pastry, it was such a relief.' Recipes are short and simple, and she often squeezes in insightful hints for making things work perfectly.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Violence is random and routine, but when the burned body of a mixed-blood boy named Johnnie Sanders is discovered, his death shocks a part-time policeman named Wyatt Earp. And it is a matter of strangely personal importance to Doc Holliday, the frail twenty-six-year-old dentist who has just opened an office at No. 24, Dodge House. &#160; Beautifully educated, born to the life of a Southern gentleman, Dr. John Henry Holliday is given an awful choice at the age of twenty-two&#58; die within months in Atlanta or leave everyone and everything he loves in the hope that the dry air and sunshine of the West will restore him to health. Young, scared, lonely, and sick, he arrives on the rawest edge of the Texas frontier just as an economic crash wrecks the dreams of a nation. Soon, with few alternatives open to him, Doc Holliday is gambling professionally; he is also living with M&aacute;ria Katarina Harony, a high-strung Hungarian whore with dazzling turquoise eyes, who can quote Latin classics right back at him. Kate makes it her business to find Doc the high-stakes poker games that will support them both in high style. It is Kate who insists that the couple travel to Dodge City, because &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where the money is.&rdquo; And that is where the unlikely friendship of Doc Holliday...",

Hamilton&rsquo;s ease and comfort in a kitchen were instilled in her at an early age when her parents hosted grand parties, often for more than one hundred friends and neighbors. The smells of spit-roasted lamb, apple wood smoke, and rosemary garlic marinade became as necessary to her as her own skin.Blood, Bones & Butter follows an unconventional journey through the many kitchens Hamilton has inhabited through the years&#58; the rural kitchen of her childhood, where her adored mother stood over the six-burner with an oily wooden spoon in hand; the kitchens of France, Greece, and Turkey, where she was often fed by complete...",

Kathy had long ago put this idyllic past behind her, but when two of her Hailsham friends come back into her life, she stops resisting the pull of memory.And so, as her friendship with Ruth is rekindled, and as the feelings that long ago fueled her adolescent crush on Tommy begin to deepen into love, Kathy recalls their years at Hailsham. She describes happy scenes of boys and girls growing up together, unperturbed-even comforted-by their isolation. But she describes other scenes as well: of discord and misunderstanding that hint at a dark secret behind Hailsham s nurturing facade. With the dawning clarity of hindsight, the three friends are compelled to face the truth about their childhood-and about their lives now.A tale of deceptive simplicity, NeverLet Me Goslowly reveals an extraordinary emotional depth and resonance-and takes its place among Kazuo Ishiguro s finest work.",

        "review": "An odyssey for one of the most iconic figures in comics stretches from prehistory to the end of time, revisiting and reimagining Batman's mythology through a complex narrative. Writer Morrison and a team of artists pick up from the end of Morrison's Final Crisis and Batman&#58; RIP. Bruce Wayne is lost in time after killing Darkseid, a godlike being of pure evil. Piecing together the memories of his past that he's lost and slowly realizing he's been turned into a human booby trap meant to destroy the universe by Darkseid, Bruce is pulled through eras of Gotham City's history that include confrontations with cavemen, witch hunters, pirates, cowboys, and 20th-century cultists. These adventures culminate in a return to the present where he must rely on his fellow superheroes to save him from Darkseid's curse. Morrison's story is designed to add to Batman's aura as a timeless, mythical hero, but the time jumps and Bruce's amnesia sometimes create an uneven narrative. The story also asks readers to possess a wealth of familiarity with the character's decades-long history, making the book not as accessible to newer fans. Different artists&mdash;all strong, colorful storytellers&mdash;give each time period its own mood. (Feb.)",

The audio's most memorable moments feature the humility-and eccentricity-of the two spiritual leaders who, despite their deep religious commitment, refuse to be placed on a pedestal. From the ail-ing Jewish leader breaking out into whimsical songs in the middle of his grueling medical treatments and his Christian counterpart savoring the joys of barbecuing, Albom's characterizations brim with humor and compassion.

        "review": "Houck's debut YA fantasy, which she self-published in 2009, is richly imagined, but pacing and technique lag behind her inventiveness. Eighteen-year-old Kelsey Hayes gets a temporary summer job working at a one-ring circus that features a white Bengal tiger named Dhiren. Kelsey and Ren, as she calls the tiger, form an immediate bond, and when a mysterious businessman purchases Ren, Kelsey is asked to escort him to his new home on an Indian reserve (despite her complete lack of experience). Given extensive foreshadowing, it's no surprise that Ren turns into a man once back in his native land, inspiring Kelsey to break the ancient curse that forces Ren to shape-shift. The attractive premise is let down by wooden dialogue, excessive detail, and wobbly mechanics; Kelsey's plainspoken narration more often befits a preteen than a high school graduate ('Poor thing. All alone with no girl tiger and no tiger cubs'). Houck doesn't quite realize her potential in this outing. Two companion books, Tiger's Quest and Tiger's Voyage, are due later in 2011. Ages 12 up.

In his widely acclaimed A Game of Thrones, he introduced us to an extraordinary world of wonder, intrigue, and adventure. Now, in the eagerly awaited second volume in this epic saga, he once again proves himself a master myth-maker, setting a standard against which all other fantasy novels will be measured for years to come.Time is out of joint. The summer of peace and plenty, ten years long, is drawing to a close, and the harsh, chill winter approaches like an angry beast. Two great leaders--Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon&#151;who held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead...victims of royal treachery.

Life can change in an instant because of one small mistake. For Glen Bauer, all it takes is a quick jerk of the steering wheel, intended to scare a reckless driver. But the reckless driver is killed, and just like that, Glen&#8217;s placid suburban existence begins to unravel. Written in part as a confessional letter from Glen to his daughter, Sara, Long Drive Home evokes the sharp-eyed observation of Tom Perrotta and the pathos of Dan Chaon in its trenchant portrait of contemporary American life. When Glen realizes no one else saw the accident, he impulsively lies about what happened&#8212;to the police, to his wife, even to Sara, who was in the backseat at the time of the crash. But a tenacious detective thinks Sara might have seen more than she knows, or more than her parents will let her tell. And when Glen tries to prevent the detective from questioning Sara, he finds himself in a high-stakes cat-and-mouse game that could end in a lawsuit or prison. What he doesn&#8217;t see coming is the reaction of his wife, Liz&#8212;a panicked plan that threatens to tear their family apart in the name of saving it. But what...",

Glen is an accountant living in New Jersey with his successful wife, Liz, and their six-year-old daughter, Sara. On an ordinary drive home from school, a series of mundane decisions grow increasingly dire and culminate in a car accident that sets road-raging Glen onto a path of deception and self-destruction. The novel is told from Glen's perspective, in part through a confessional letter written to Sara, an obvious but nonetheless effective tension builder. It's a slow burn as guilt chips away at Glen's sanity and his marriage crumbles, his impotent angst finds an unlikely outlet, and he comes under ever more scrutiny by a strangely motivated detective. Allison's triumph is the skillful rendering of Glen's transformation as a basically good guy whose fatal flaw leads him to a cataclysmically stupid decision. And while other characters fare less well&mdash;the cop on Glen's tail is straight out of an airport thriller, and Liz isn't given the chance to break through her mercenary and fundamentally unpleasant mold&mdash;Allison's effortless prose and playful genre mixing showcase a burgeoning talent.

After risking the hazardous journey across the Atlantic, these Americans embarked on a greater journey in the City of Light. Most had never left home, never experienced a different culture. None had any guarantee of success. That they achieved so much for themselves and their country profoundly altered American history. As David McCullough writes, &#8220;Not all pioneers went west.&#8221; Elizabeth Blackwell, the first female doctor in America, was one of this intrepid band. Another was Charles Sumner, who enrolled at the Sorbonne because of a burning desire to know more about everything. There he saw black students with the same ambition he had, and when he returned home, he would become the most powerful, unyielding voice for abolition in the U.S. Senate, almost at the cost of his life. Two staunch friends, James Fenimore Cooper and Samuel F. B. Morse, worked unrelentingly every day in Paris, Cooper writing and Morse painting what would be his masterpiece. From something he saw in France, Morse would also bring home his momentous idea for the telegraph. Pianist Louis Moreau Gottschalk from New...",

C. Gwynne&rsquo;s Empire of the Summer Moon spans two astonishing stories. The first traces the rise and fall of the Comanches, the most powerful Indian tribe in American history. The second entails one of the most remarkable narratives ever to come out of the Old West&#58; the epic saga of the pioneer woman Cynthia Ann Parker and her mixed-blood son Quanah, who became the last and greatest chief of the Comanches. Although readers may be more familiar with the tribal names Apache and Sioux, it was in fact the legendary fighting ability of the Comanches that determined just how and when the American West opened up. Comanche boys became adept bareback riders by age six; full Comanche braves were considered the best horsemen who ever rode. They were so masterful at war and so skillful with their arrows and lances that they stopped the northern drive of colonial Spain from Mexico and halted the French expansion westward from Louisiana. White settlers arriving in Texas from the eastern United States were surprised to find the frontier being rolled backward by Comanches incensed by the invasion of their tribal lands. So effective were the Comanches that they forced the creation of the Texas...",

        "description": "Few companies in history have ever been as successful and as admired as Google, the company that has transformed the Internet and become an indispensable part of our lives. How has Google done it? Veteran technology reporter Steven Levy was granted unprecedented access to the company, and in this revelatory book he takes readers inside Google headquarters &mdash; the Googleplex &mdash; to show how Google works.While they were still students at Stanford, Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin revolutionized Internet search. They followed this brilliant innovation with another, as two of Google&rsquo;s earliest employees found a way to do what no one else had&#58; make billions of dollars from Internet advertising. With this cash cow (until Google&rsquo;s IPO nobody other than Google management had any idea how lucrative the company&rsquo;s ad business was), Google was able to expand dramatically and take on other transformative projects&#58; more efficient data centers, open-source cell phones, free Internet video (YouTube), cloud computing, digitizing books, and much more. The key to Google&rsquo;s success in all these businesses, Levy reveals, is its engineering mind-set and adoption of such Internet values as speed, openness, experimentation, and risk taking. After its unapologetically elitist approach to hiring, Google pampers its engineers &mdash; free food and dry cleaning, on-site doctors and masseuses &mdash; and gives them all the resources they need to...",

        "review": "Dense, driven examination of the pioneering search engine that changed the face of the Internet.Thoroughly versed in technology reporting,Wiredsenior writer Levy (The Perfect Thing&#58; How the iPod Shuffles Commerce, Culture, and Coolness, 2006, etc.) deliberates at great length about online behemoth Google and creatively documents the company's genesis from a 'feisty start-up to a market-dominating giant.' The author capably describes Google's founders, Stanford grads Larry Page and Sergey Brin, as sharp, user-focused and steadfastly intent on 'organizing all the world's information.' Levy traces how Google's intricately developed, intrepid beginnings and gradual ascent over a competitive marketplace birthed an advertising-fueled 'money machine' (especially following its IPO in 2004), and he follows the expansion and operation of the company's liberal work campus ('Googleplex') and its distinctively selective hiring process (Page still signs off on every new hire). The author was afforded an opportunity to observe the company's operations, development, culture and advertising model from within the infrastructure for two years with full managerial cooperation. From there, he performed hundreds of interviews with past and current employees and discovered the type of 'creative disorganization' that can either make or break a business. Though clearly in awe of Google's crowning significance, Levy evenhandedly notes the company's more glaring deficiencies, like the 2004 cyber-attack that forced the removal of the search engine from mainland China, a decision vehemently unsupported by co-founder Brin. Though the author offers plenty of well-known information, it's his catbird-seat vantage point that really gets to the good stuff.Outstanding reportage delivered in the upbeat, informative fashion for which Levy is well known.",

        "description": "Do twins begin in the womb?Or in a better place?Kaeleigh and Raeanne are identical down to the dimple. As daughters of a district-court judge father and a politician mother, they are an all-American family -- on the surface. Behind the facade each sister has her own dark secret, and that's where their differences begin.For Kaeleigh, she's the misplaced focus of Daddy's love, intended for a mother whose presence on the campaign trail means absence at home. All that Raeanne sees is Daddy playing a game of favorites -- and she is losing. If she has to lose, she will do it on her own terms, so she chooses drugs, alcohol, and sex.Secrets like the ones the twins are harboring are not meant to be kept -- from each other or anyone else. Pretty soon it's obvious that neither sister can handle it alone, and one sister must step up to save the other, but the question is -- who?",

        "review": "Using free verse as her vehicle, Hopkins (Crank,Glass) takes readers on a harrowing ride into the psyches of 16-year-old identical twins Kaeleigh and Raeanne, both of whom are racing toward self-destruction. The girls' family appears picture-perfect. Their father is a prominent judge, their mother is running for Congress, and both girls do well in school. But ever since an accident, 'Mom doesn't love anyone./ She is marble. Beautiful./ Frigid. Easily stained/ by her family. What's left/ of us, anyway. We are corpses.' Raeanne seeks escape in sex and drugs; Kaileigh binges and cuts herself. Brief, gutsy confessions reveal a history of sexual abuse and emotional neglect, and it's not clear that both girls will survive it. Hopkins's verse is not only lean and sinuous, it also demonstrates a mastery of technique. Strategically placed concrete verse includes a poem about revenge shaped like a double-edged sword; in another, about jealousy, the lines form one heart reflecting another, until a rupture breaks the symmetry at the bottom. Often, the twins' entries mirror each other, on facing pages: although used differently in the two poems, the same key words are set off in corresponding stanzas ('think./ How/ different/ life./ could be' reads one set of key words). Those for whomUncle Vampiremeans something will anticipate the still-breathless climax; all others, including most of the target audience, will be shocked.

        "description": "&ldquo;When all choice is taken from you, life becomes a game of survival.&rdquo;Five teenagers from different parts of the country. Three girls. Two guys. Four straight. One gay. Some rich. Some poor. Some from great families. Some with no one at all. All living their lives as best they can, but all searching . . . for freedom, safety, community, family, love. What they don&rsquo;t expect, though, is all that can happen when those powerful little words, &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; are said for all the wrong reasons. These are five moving stories that remain separate at first, then weave together to tell a larger, more powerful story&#8211;a story about making choices, taking leaps of faith, falling down, and growing up. And figuring out what sex and love are all about.TRICKS is informed and inspired by living near Las Vegas&#8211;a big teen prostitution scene&#8211;and by the fact that teen prostitution is not exclusively the result of kids running away from abuse. Kids from &ldquo;better&rdquo; families are selling themselves for hefty sums in order to finance addictions or even just to buy jewelry or clothing. In some cases, parents prostitute their children for the same reason. So what happens to the kids who are asking themselves, and asking us, &ldquo;Can I ever feel OK about myself?&rdquo;Highly charged, TRICKS is a gripping experience that turns you on and repels you at the same time.",

        "review": "Hopkins again tackles a serious societal problem, this time focusing on teen prostitution. Fans of her work will recognize both her signature free verses and the gritty details she weaves within them. Newcomers, however, may be shocked by the graphic depictions of five struggling teens who find themselves turning tricks (one realizes her mother has sold her &ldquo;for a good time&rdquo; with a stranger, while another recounts &ldquo;pretending to enjoy... deviant sex&rdquo; to earn the trust of a guard at an ultra-strict religious rehabilitation camp). Some plotting seems clich&eacute;d, such as the story of a preacher's daughter from Idaho, whose mother banishes her to the Tears of Zion camp after catching her with her boyfriend. While each story unfolds slowly, readers will understand the protagonists' desperation as well as their complete powerlessness once their descents have begun. Each story is unique (one teen needs money, another was thrown out because of his sexuality, still another was simply looking for love from the wrong person); while readers may connect with some characters more than others, they will long remember each painful story.

        "review": "This is the story of Dylan and the relationships he has with the girl he loves, his best friend, and his father. Told partially in flashbacks and augmented by passages from a death row prisoner's memoir, it is fast-paced, complex and interesting&#151;until it isn't. The storyline about how Dylan became so indebted to his best friend Wade that he risks his relationships and freedom to help him is the second best part of the book. The true best part comes toward the end, when Dylan reunites with his father and begins to learn to truth about what happened on the night his father was accused of murder. All of the dialogue, scenarios and feelings expressed by the characters, particularly Dylan's grandmother, ring true and seem poignant from this point on through the end. It is a startling contrast to the pages dedicated to Dylan's relationship with Jess. The relationship that should form the center of the book feels unrealistic and forced next to the relationships Dylan has with his dad and Wade. Reviewer: Jennifer Waldrop",

As Gerald tells Piggie, 'a hippo on your trunk is heavy.' But there is more to it. Rhino shows up and he wants a turn, so Gerald lifts them both onto his trunk, and so on, until he has lifted Hippo, Rhino, and Hippo's big sister and her piano on his trunk. As readers expect, there is more to the story of Gerald's bandaged trunk than first imagined. Willems's now classic and predictable formula, complete with an uncluttered background, large-type word balloons, and expressive characters, is as effective as ever. The style may now be familiar, but the 'Elephant & Piggie' stories remain fresh, amusing, and relevant to readers, who will sit on the edge of their seats as they eagerly anticipate the surprising turn of events. A winning addition to the series.&mdash;Kristine M. Casper, Huntington Public Library, NY",

        "review": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewThe debut novel from Patrick Rothfuss -- the first installment of an epic fantasy trilogy entitled the Kingkiller Chronicle -- not only lives up to its extraordinary pre-press hype (DAW president Elizabeth Wollheim called it 'the most brilliant first fantasy novel I have read in over 30 years as an editor'), it surpasses it. When fantasy fans begin reading The Name of the Wind, they should be fully prepared to lose all contact with the outside world while immersed in this highly original and mesmerizing tale of magic, love, and adventure.The story revolves around Kvothe, an enigmatic red-haired innkeeper who, as he shares his incredible life story with a renowned scribe, turns out to be much more than he appears. Born into a family of nomadic court performers, Kvothe's unconventional education was broadened by spending time with fellow travelers like Abenthy, an elderly arcanist whose knowledge included, among other things, knowing the name of the wind. After his parents are brutally murdered by mythical beings known as the Chandrian, Kvothe vows to learn more about the godlike group, and after suffering through years of homelessness, he finally gets his chance when he is admitted into the prestigious University. But the pursuit of arcane knowledge brings with it unforeseen dangers, as the young student quickly learnsWith the release of his first novel, Rothfuss (who has already been compared to the likes of Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, and George R.&nbsp;R. Martin) is poised to be crowned the new king of epic fantasy. The Name of the Wind won't just impress longtime fantasy fans; it will absolutely blow them away -- an unprecedented, utterly breathtaking storytelling tour de force.Paul Goat Allen",

Told to and compiled by author and audio expert Bill Gibson, Quincy's observations, culled from over a year of in-depth interviews, are collected and presented in book form and on an accompanying DVD-ROM, providing an unparalleled course of instruction from one of the true legends of American music. Reaching back to his early successes, Quincy discusses the techniques learned as an arranger for such legendary performers as Count Basie and Ray Charles, as a touring bandleader, and as a young producer with his first pop successes. Coauthor Gibson, in chapters such as 'Discovering Talent,' 'The Producer/Engineer Relationship,' and 'Tools for Success,' outlines the many skills Quincy developed and broadened as he graduated to film and TV work, his solo recordings, and his game-changing albums with Michael Jackson, as well as more recent productions. With invaluable advice on subjects such as songwriting, scoring, and the modern music business - to be expanded on in subsequent volumes - Q on Producing provides the foundation for what is sure to be the most anticipated series of tutorials on music production ever created.",

        "review": "The first in a planned multivolume set, this title is more of a tribute to Jones and his career than a vehicle for practical advice. The stories are certainly remarkable considering Jones's lengthy and diverse career, but they are often presented in a stream-of-consciousness way that may detract from the reading experience. The main problem is simply that the content doesn't match the stated intent; this is a blend of anecdotal stories by Jones and laudatory essays by fellow artists (even a recipe for Thriller Ribs is thrown in for good measure), but it's not 'essential reading for aspiring producers and musicians everywhere,' as the publisher claims. Jones mentions working with filmmaker Sidney Lumet&mdash;scoring such films as The Pawnbroker and The Wiz&mdash;and one hopes future volumes in this series will address the details and specifics of Jones's production style, which could result in a work as important to his craft as Lumet's Making Movies is for filmmaking. (The accompanying DVD, exploring production techniques in the studio, was not seen.)

        "review": "Bestseller Patterson's new thriller with its focus on the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been overtaken by events  (there's no mention of Israel's unilateral withdrawal from the  Gaza Strip in 2005 or the recent fighting across the Lebanese  border), but the underlying political issues may be enough for  most readers to put the real world aside and suspend disbelief.  Harvard-trained attorney David Wolfe, a San Franciscan on the  verge of a congressional campaign, has his plans derailed when  his law school classmate (and one-time lover), Palestinian Hana  Arif, asks him to defend her from charges that she led a  conspiracy that assassinated dovish Israeli leader Amos  Ben-Aron. Inspired by idealism and lingering passion, Wolfe  jeopardizes his political future by taking the case. His  suspicion that the suicide bombers who attacked Ben-Aron were  aided by a security breach leads him to Israel and Lebanon.  While Patterson (Conviction) attempts to portray the issues  fairly, the introduction of a soap-operaish subplot undercuts  his intended high purpose, and the resolution of the mystery is  too predictable to surprise. 10-city author tour.

There&rsquo;s the melody that reminds her of the summer she spent rubbing baby oil on her stomach in pursuit of the perfect tan. A dance beat that makes her think of using a fake ID to slip into a nightclub. A dirge that marked the years she spent trying to get pregnant.For better or for worse, music is the language of memory. It is also the language of love.In the aftermath of a series of personal tragedies, Zoe throws herself into her career as a music therapist. When an unexpected friendship slowly blossoms into love, she makes plans for a new life, but to her shock and inevitable rage, some people&#8212;even those she loves and trusts most&#8212;don&rsquo;t want that to happen.Sing You Homeis about identity, love, marriage, and parenthood. It&rsquo;s about people wanting to do the right thing for the greater good, even as they work to fulfill their own personal desires and dreams.

Though the former couple went quite separate ways, their fates remained entangled&#58; After veering into alcoholism, Max is saved in multiple senses by his fundamentalist conversion; Zoe, for her part, finds healing relief in music therapy and the friendship, then romantic love with Vanessa, her counselor. After Zoe and Vanessa, now married, decide to have a baby, they realize that they must join battle with Max, who objects on both religious and financial grounds.

        "description": "Winner of the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for General NonfictionThe Emperor of All Maladies is a magnificent, profoundly humane &#8220;biography&#8221; of cancer&#8212;from its first documented appearances thousands of years ago through the epic battles in the twentieth century to cure, control, and conquer it to a radical new understanding of its essence. Physician, researcher, and award-winning science writer, Siddhartha Mukherjee examines cancer with a cellular biologist&#8217;s precision, a historian&#8217;s perspective, and a biographer&#8217;s passion. The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with&#8212;and perished from&#8212;for more than five thousand years. The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance, but also of hubris, paternalism, and misperception. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out &#8220;war against cancer.&#8221; The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist. From the Persian Queen Atossa, whose Greek slave cut off her malignant breast, to the nineteenth-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to Mukherjee&#8217;s own leukemia patient, Carla, The Emperor of All Maladies is about the...",

        "description": "Bestselling author Jennet Conant brings us a stunning account of Julia and Paul Child&#8217;s experiences as members of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in the Far East during World War II and the tumultuous years when they were caught up in the McCarthy Red spy hunt in the 1950s and behaved with bravery and honor. It is the fascinating portrait of a group of idealistic men and women who were recruited by the citizen spy service, slapped into uniform, and dispatched to wage political warfare in remote outposts in Ceylon, India, and China. The eager, inexperienced 6 foot 2 inch Julia springs to life in these pages, a gangly golf-playing California girl who had never been farther abroad than Tijuana. Single and thirty years old when she joined the staff of Colonel William Donovan, Julia volunteered to be part of the OSS&#8217;s ambitious mission to develop a secret intelligence network across Southeast Asia. Her first post took her to the mountaintop idyll of Kandy, the headquarters of Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, the supreme commander of combined operations. Julia reveled in the glamour and intrigue of her overseas assignment and lifealtering romance with the much older and more sophisticated Paul Child, who took her on trips into the jungle, introduced her to the joys of curry, and insisted on educating both her mind and palate. A painter drafted to build war rooms, Paul was a colorful, complex personality. Conant uses extracts from his letters in which his sharp...",

Few of us, however, know much about their hush-hush activities and even less about their close friendship with Jane Foster (1912-1979), an O.S.S. worker who was indicted, but not tried as a Soviet operative. Jennet Conant's A Covert Affair reveals the fascinating story of the couple's high-level service (Julia reported directly to O.S.S. chief 'Wild Bill' Donovan), but perhaps its most intriguing revelations concern the Child's staunch support of their embattled friend, a loyalty that eventually cost Paul his job.

Emmy&#174; award&#8211;winning journalist, TV host, and New York Times bestselling author Rita Cosby has always asked the tough questions in her interviews with the world&#8217;s top newsmakers. Now, in a compelling and powerful memoir, she reveals how she uncovered an amazing personal story of heroism and courage, the untold secrets of a man she has known all her life&#58; her father. Years after her mother&#8217;s tragic death, Rita finally nerved herself to sort through her mother&#8217;s stored belongings, never dreaming what a dramatic story was waiting for her. Opening a battered tan suitcase, she discovered it belonged to her father&#8212;the enigmatic man who had divorced her mother and left when Rita was still a teenager. Rita knew little of her father&#8217;s past&#58; just that he had left Poland after World War II, and that his many scars, visible and not, bore mute witness to some past tragedy. He had always refused to answer questions. Now, however, she held in her hand stark mementos from the youth of the man she knew only as Richard Cosby, proud American&#58; a worn Polish Resistance armband; rusted tags bearing a prisoner number and the words Stalag IVB; and an identity card for an ex-POW bearing the name Ryszard Kossobudzki. Gazing at these profoundly telling relics, the well-known journalist realized that her father&#8217;s story...",

In the 1980s, singer-songwriter and actor Rick Springfield seemed to have it all&#58; a megahit single in &ldquo;Jessie&rsquo;s Girl,&rdquo; sold-out concert tours, follow-up hits that sold more than 17 million albums and became the pop soundtrack for an entire generation, and 12 million daily viewers who avidly tuned in to General Hospital to swoon over his portrayal of the handsome Dr. Noah Drake. Yet lurking behind his success as a pop star and soap opera heartthrob and his unstoppable drive was a moody, somber, and dark soul, one filled with depression and insecurity. In Late, Late at Night, the memoir his millions of fans have been waiting for, Rick takes readers inside the highs and lows of his extraordinary life. By turns winningly funny and heartbreakingly sad, every page resonates with Rick&rsquo;s witty, wry, self-deprecating, brutally honest voice. On one level, he reveals the inside story of his ride to the top of the entertainment world. On a second, deeper level, he recounts with unsparing candor the forces that have driven his life, including his longtime battle with depression and thoughts of suicide, the shattering...",

Behind that seductive persona though, this versatile Australian was a brooding, even suicidal bundle of nerves.

Ultimately uplifting, this disarmingly candid memoir strikes deeper than any mere celebrity autobiography.",

It will take considerable quantities of each to resolve all the challenges facing Vivenna and Siri, princesses of Idris; Susebron the God King; Lightsong, reluctant god of bravery, and mysterious Vasher, the Warbreaker.",

        "review": "Epic fantasy heavyweight Sanderson (the Mistborn series) pens a powerful stand-alone tale of unpredictable loyalties, dark intrigue and dangerous magic. To keep a treaty made long ago, the king of Idris must send his daughter to marry Susebron, the God King of Hallandren. Loath to part with his eldest daughter, Vivenna, King Dedelin instead sends his youngest daughter, tomboyish 17-year-old Siri, who struggles to make sense of the schemers and spies in Susebron's court. Hoping to rescue her sister, Vivenna joins a group of Idrian operatives with questionable motives. As Vivenna comes to terms with her magical abilities, resurrected hero Lightsong questions the role of the undead Returned Gods, who command Hallandren's mighty army of zombie soldiers. Sanderson melds complex, believable characters, a marvelous world and thoughtful, ironic humor into an extraordinary and highly entertaining story.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "review": "Gr 9 Up&mdash;Interweaving a young woman's past and present experiences in alternating chapters, this novel reveals how Clara's romance with Christian tips slowly but inexorably toward obsession during her junior and senior years of high school. After graduation, Clara and her father slip off to a Washington beach town in secret to escape her now ex-boyfriend's frightening and unpredictable reach into her current life. In this cunningly crafted narrative, readers will slowly come to understand the danger posed by the cute Scandinavian boy who swept Clara off her feet and how what feels like love can crack and crumble when an insecure and possessive guy won't accept their breakup. Her summer job at a lighthouse and the friends she and her father meet, especially Finn, who sails his family's tourist boat with his brother, make Clara hopeful about the future. The suspense rises like the tide while readers applaud the teen's healthy new life and relationships but fear that she hasn't seen the last of the unstable and unpredictable Christian. Characters and new love ring true and would make this fine chick lit in and of itself, but the looming specter of the ex-boyfriend finding Clara makes it a novel with an appealing edge. Fear tinges this summer romance and underscores the issue of abusive and claustrophobic relationships among teens.&mdash;Suzanne Gordon, Lanier High School, Sugar Hill, GA",

Her fellow sister wives are to be trusted one day and feared the next, and Rhine is desperate to communicate to her twin brother that she is safe and alive.

You've tried dozens of diets, you've sweated so much that your drippings could fill an Olympic-size pool, and you've become convinced that skinny was synonymous with starvation. Those answers undoubtedly were the wrong ones. The real secret to achieving -- and maintaining -- the body you want is this&#58; biology.In YOU&#58; On a Diet, Dr. Michael Roizen and Dr. Mehmet Oz taught you how to avoid the most common dieting pitfalls -- from both a biological and psychological perspective. This revised edition has all of the original goods, and more!

According to Roizen  and Oz, waist measurement, not weight, is the most important  factor in mortality related to obesity, and understanding the  relationship between chemicals and hormones influencing hunger  and those signaling satiety is the key to ending yo-yo dieting.  Most diets fail, Roizen and Oz conclude, because body chemistry  overrules the best plans and intentions. To restore the body's  natural ability to balance hunger and satiety and offset the  effects of stress on food choices, they list foods and  supplements that fight fat, decrease appetite and combat  inflammation that causes disease. Roizen and Oz pack in a lot of  material-quizzes, 'factoids' and 'myth busters' along with diet  and exercise plans, recipes and a two-week 'rebooting'  program-in bite-sized portions, giving readers a chance to  absorb and apply what they learn. For those considering medical  intervention, they discuss current options for drugs and  surgery. (Oct.)   Copyright 2006 Reed Business Information.",

She began drinking before class, often blacked out at bars, and fell into destructive relationships. At nineteen, already an out-of-control alcoholic, she was pregnant. Accepting the heartbreaking fact that she was incapable of taking care of her son herself, she gave him up for adoption to her aunt and uncle. They named him Tommy and took him home with them to Massachusetts. When he was nine months old, the boy was diagnosed with leukemia&#8212;but Kelle&rsquo;s parents, wanting the best for her, kept her mostly in the dark about his health. When Tommy died he was only fourteen months old. Having lost him irretrievably, Kelle went into an accelerating downward spiral of self-destruction. She emerged from this free fall only when her desire to stop drinking connected her with those who helped her to get sober.In stirring, hypnotic prose, I Wore the Ocean in the Shape of a Girl explores the most painful aspects of Kelle&rsquo;s addiction and loss with unflinching honesty and bold determination. Urgent and vital, exquisite and raw, her story is as much about maternal love as it is about survival, as much about acceptance as it is about forgiveness. Kelle&rsquo;s longing for her son remains twenty-five years after his death. It is an ache intensified, as she lost him twice&#8212;first to adoption and then...",

Things get better&#58; she finishes college, then grad school, and gets a job she likes at an artists' residency center. Through it all, she wonders about the details of her son's brief life.

She is Eilleen Twain, one of five children born into poverty in rural Canada, where her family often didn&rsquo;t have enough food to send her to school with lunch. She&rsquo;s the teenage girl who helped her mother and young siblings escape to a battered woman&rsquo;s shelter to put an end to the domestic violence in her family home.

It was the early part of the great Depression, and for Jacob, now ninety, the circus world he remembers was both his salvation and a living hell. A veterinary student just shy of a degree, he was put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It was there that he met Marlena, the beautiful equestrian star married to August, the charismatic but twisted animal trainer. And he met Rosie, an untrainable elephant who was the great gray hope for this third-rate traveling show. The bond that grew among this unlikely trio was one of love and trust, and, ultimately, it was their only hope for survival.",

This is a bodice ripper of a hundred thousand pearly buttons, ripped off one at a time with agonizing restraint.

        "review": "Cartoonist and New Yorker editor Donohue celebrates dads who cook with a delightful compendium of essays, recipes, cartoons, and interviews. Noting that American fathers 'now account for nearly a third of the time a family spends cooking,' Donohue&mdash;himself a cooking dad&mdash;checks how this trend is working out by soliciting a variety of personal perspectives. Among them are such professional voices as Mario Batali and cookbook author Mark Bittman. Not surprisingly, many of the contributors are writers, such as Stephen King, Jim Harrison, Mohammed Naseehu Ali, and Wesley Stace. Under the heading, 'In the Trenches,' Donohue explores the routines of other average guys&#58; a Brooklyn fireman, a software engineer, and a father of two in New Orleans. And while few are clueless in the kitchen, it is their wit, devotion, and candor that inspire. For example, in 'Who the Man?' Jesse Green writes about being the noncook in a two-dad household suddenly faced with kitchen duty; and Matt Greenberg creates a screenplay explaining how to grill. Less a production but equally intriguing is what men cook&#58; gumbo, fish tacos, roast chicken. (May)",

If so, you'll want to meet 'The Sisters', Gail Boushey and Joan Moser.  Based on literacy learning and motivation research, they created a structure called The Daily Five which has been practiced and refined in their own classrooms for ten years, and shared with thousands of teachers throughout the United States. The Daily Five is a series of literacy tasks (reading to self, reading with someone, writing, word work, and listening to reading) which students complete daily while the teacher meets with small groups or confers with individuals.This book not only explains the philosophy behind the structure, but shows you how to carefully and systematically train your students to participate in each of the five components.Explicit modeling practice, reflecting and refining take place during the launching phase, preparing the foundation for a year of meaningful content instruction tailored to meet the needs of each child.The Daily Five is more than a management system or a curriculum framework; it is a structure that will help students develop the habits that lead to a lifetime of independent literacy.",

She discusses her quest for sex with a 'black man,' which  doesn't work out because the date she finds on  ChocolateSingles.com has a penis so large, she 'would have had  to be the size of the Lincoln Tunnel to accommodate that thing.'  After him, there's a 'little midget,' but she sobers up before  sleeping with him. Next come a number of would-be partners with  penises too small to consider. Finally, there's a guy Handler  does sleep with, only an embarrassing incident involving a  'giant skid mark' prevents her from seeing him again. By the  end, Handler considers settling down with one man, which might  actually net her more sex than these mostly unconsummated  one-night stands. Anyone who laughs at the mere mention of  vaginas and penises may find Handler's book almost as much fun  as getting drunk and waking up in some stranger's bed. Agent,  Michael Broussard Dupree.

This collection of the first six issues of the ongoing  series opens with police officer Rick Grimes awakening from a  gunshot-induced coma. From here, he's immediately dragged into a  world where dangerous revenants are shambling amok without any  sort of an explanation. From the moment Grimes comes to, it's a  harrowing battle to avoid hordes of decomposing zombies and a  hope-against-all-odds search for his missing family. Grimes  makes his way to Atlanta, the nearest large city where there may  be other living people, and events take several unexpected turns  upon his arrival, as he meets up with a rural encampment of  survivors. Of course, as in recent hit movies 28 Days Later...  and Dawn of the Dead, the last humans may turn out to be as much  a danger as the zombies. Forceful scripting that gives the book  a strong grounding in reality, crisp b&w; artwork, a shocking  final sequence and brisk, gory proceedings elevate this book  from the trash heap of pedestrian horror comics.

        "review": "Starred Review.Hailed as a humorist for the digital age, Australian graphic designer Thorne (www.27bslash6.com) became an internet sensation after posting e-mail correspondences in which he attempted to pay his chiropractic bill with a crude drawing of a spider. Thorne's first book is a laugh-out-loud collection of his e-mail exchanges and satirical essays. As a rule, Thorne says he never initiates an e-mail; he just responds 'stupidly' to what he receives. The book includes the biting 'Please Design a Logo For Me. With Pie Charts. For Free,' considered one of the most-forwarded e-mails of all time, as well as 'Missing Missy,' in which Thorne designs a poster to help a friend find her missing cat; he has great fun-at his friend's expense. The book reads as if The Onion published Letters From a Nut, but some of Thorn's antics-such as inviting himself to a neighbor's housewarming party-will make readers squirm. Others may offend ('Sponsor a Poor Black Boy'), or shock ('Belly Messages,' in which Thorne pretends to be a horny woman on the Internet). Thorne's electronic voice is pointed, effective, and childishly exuberant, a bracing mix. His sense of humor could be called immature, but some people just want to have fun; Thorne does so at everyone else's expense. Illus.(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.  All rights reserved.",

        "description": "'I'm not a businessman-I'm a business, man.'  &#151;Jay-Z Some people think Jay-Z is just another rapper. Others see him as just another celebrity/mega-star. The reality is, no matter what you think Jay-Z is, he first and foremost a business. And as much as Martha Stewart or Oprah, he has turned himself into a lifestyle. You can wake up to the local radio station playing Jay-Z's latest hit, spritz yourself with his 9IX cologne, slip on a pair of his Rocawear jeans, lace up your Reebok S. Carter sneakers, catch a Nets basketball game in the afternoon, and grab dinner at The Spotted Pig before heading to an evening performance of the Jay-Z-backed Broadway musical Fela! and a nightcap at his 40/40 Club. He'll profit at every turn of your day. But despite Jay-Z's success, there are still many Americans whose impressions of him are foggy, outdated, or downright incorrect. Surprisingly to many, he honed his business philosophy not at a fancy B school, but on the streets of Brooklyn, New York and beyond as a drug dealer in the 1980s. Empire State of Mind tells the story behind Jay-Z's rise to the top as told by the people who lived it with him- from classmates at Brooklyn's George Westinghouse High School; to the childhood friend who got him into the drug trade; to the DJ who convinced him to stop dealing and focus on music. This book explains just how Jay-Z propelled himself from the bleak streets of Brooklyn to the heights of the business world. Zack...",

        "review": "Forbes staffer Greenburg's first book is a fond look at a successful idol; in fact, the author thanks 'Jay-Z for living a life worthy of chronicling.' Celebrity enchantment aside, this effort offers little new information. Though it's not for a lack of trying; Greenburg is an enthusiastic researcher but admits to having requests to interview Jay-Z himself declined. Thus, only a few first person interviews-rambling anecdotes at that-have made the cut. Perhaps this obvious omission resulted in Greenburg's unfortunate decision to analyze the mogul's behavior. The chapter devoted to Beyonce reads like a compilation of People magazine articles: 'raised a devout Methodist...in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in Houston, Texas.' When their six-year relationship was formalized by marriage, Beyonce wore a '$5 million Lorraine Schwartz ring.' Perhaps the book's most interesting moment also illustrates Jay-Z's single-minded determination to succeed: after Greenburg met with Jay-Z's 'consigliere,' John Meneilly, to discuss the book, Jay-Z 'repurposed the memoir he'd scuttled in 2003 and released his book before this one went to press.'(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

        "description": "'The entire conversation took five minutes. When it was over, Bill and I looked at each other. It was one thing to talk about writing a language for a microprocessor and another to get the job done . . . If we'd been older or known better, Bill and I might have been put off by the task in front of us. But we were young and green enough to believe that we just might pull it off.' Paul Allen, best known as the cofounder of Microsoft, has left his mark on numerous fields, from aviation and science to rock 'n' roll, professional sports, and philanthropy. His passions and curiosity have transformed the way we live. In 2007 and again in 2008, Time named him one of the hundred most influential people in the world. It all started on a snowy day in December 1974, when he was twenty-one years old. After buying the new issue of Popular Electronics in Harvard Square, Allen ran to show it to his best friend from Seattle, Bill Gates, then a Harvard undergrad. The magazine's cover story featured the Altair 8800, the first true personal computer; Allen knew that he and Gates had the skills to code a programming language for it. When Gates agreed to collaborate on BASIC for the Altair, one of the most influential partnerships of the digital era was up and running. While much has been written about Microsoft's early years, Allen has never before told the story from his point of view. Nor has he previously talked about the details of his complex relationship with Gates...",

        "review": "The highly anticipated, eyebrow-raising memoir of the other founding partner of the Microsoft Corporation.Even at 58 and one of the wealthiest people in the world, Allen admits that writing his life story was 'one of the hardest things I've ever done.' The result is surprisingly profound and refreshingly frank. Inspired by an oral-history project he'd initiated in 2000 to commemorate his early years with Microsoft, the author begins and ends his chronicle with nods to his friendship with 'partner in crime' Bill Gates&mdash;from their beginnings driven by an all-consuming enthusiasm for computers to Gates' regular appearances at Allen's bedside as he defeated aggressive cancer. Yet it's the often-turbulent years sandwiched in between that form the indulgent crux of this heavily jargonized narrative. Allen amiably retraces his Seattle roots raised by staunch booklovers as he dabbled in circuitry and mechanics. He honed rudimentary computer-programming skills while enrolled at a private school where he met Gates, who, at 13, was already competitive and scheming of wild successes. Lofty ambitions cut Allen's collegiate career short, and, following many years of hard work, Microsoft was born in 1975, helmed by himself and increasingly tyrannical 'taskmaster' Gates. Allen writes extensively of locking horns with his partner soon after the company became profitable, and, with the same heft used to praise the successes of a company that made him rich, he skewers his co-founder for his 'mercenary opportunism' when conspired to dilute Allen's Microsoft equity after he developed cancer. His disillusionment with the company, he writes, was 'like a failed romance.' Allen spends the closing chapters elucidating his critically scrutinized interests in commercial space travel, the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence, neuroscience and, more recently, artificial intelligence.A diligently crafted scrapbook of gratitude, accusation and excess, guaranteed to entertain and even ruffle a few feathers.",

Nevertheless, this can be a good resource for individuals wishing to embark on a self-therapy voyage.Description&#58;Purpose&#58;Depression is a common psychological disease with many options for treatment, including psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Nevertheless, many patients never seek professional treatment. In the growing trend of bibliotherapy, this book provides a self-treatment resource for individuals who suffer from depression or dysthymia.Audience&#58;The primary aim of this book is provide a self-help resource for depression sufferers. It does so with an eye towards mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), combining traditional CBT concepts with mindfulness and meditation.Features&#58;Persons who have symptoms of depression, dysthymia, or a sense of an unfulfilled life and who are looking for a self-help avenue for treatment are the intended readers. There is no particular expertise or esoteric knowledge required to fully comprehend this book. The authors are outstanding researchers and pioneers in mindfulness-based treatment.Assessment&#58;This book takes a narrative approach rather than a lecturing approach. The authors convey the sense of a conversation with the reader and impart an understanding of the difficulties faced in depression. The book progresses from an introduction to mindfulness through exercises designed to facilitate awareness of the therapeutic concepts. Vignettes help readers associate with the problems and techniques that are introduced. Small shaded boxes in the margins highlight important concepts and a CD included with the book provides guided meditations. While there are recognizable components of CBT in the book, much of it is focused on changing the readers' attitudes and ways of interpreting the world around them. It would have been nice to see more of the traditional CBT techniques to at least provide a foundation before leaping into mindfulness.",

More than 174 million Americans are gamers, and the average young person in the United States will spend ten thousand hours gaming by the age of twenty-one. According to world-renowned game designer Jane McGonigal, the reason for this mass exodus to virtual worlds is that videogames are increasingly fulfilling genuine human needs. In this groundbreaking exploration of the power and future of gaming, McGonigal reveals how we can use the lessons of game design to fix what is wrong with the real world. Drawing on positive psychology, cognitive science, and sociology, Reality Is Broken uncovers how game designers have hit on core truths about what makes us happy and utilized these discoveriesto astonishing effect in virtual environments. Videogames consistently provide the exhilarating rewards, stimulating challenges, and epic victories that are so often lacking in the real world. But why, McGonigal asks, should we use the power of games for escapist entertainment alone? Her research suggests that gamers are expert problem solvers and collaborators because they regularly cooperate with other players to overcome daunting virtual challenges, and she helped pioneer a fast-growing genre of games that aims to turn gameplay to socially positive ends. In Reality Is Broken, she reveals how these new alternate reality...",

For the nearly 183 million Americans who will spend an average of 13 hours a week playing games, McGonigal's book is a welcome validation of their pursuits. But for those who don't understand, or who may worry that our growing preoccupation with games is detrimental to society and culture, McGonigal argues persuasively that games are in fact improving us. 'Game design isn't just technological craft,' she argues, 'it's a 21st Century way of thinking and leading.' And games, she argues, particularly the new wave of Alternative Reality Games, are not about escapism but a powerful new form of collaboration and community building. The book moves effortlessly from Herodotus to Halo, stitching together an intellectually stimulating view of human culture past, present, and future. And while not downplaying the potential for negative consequences, such as 'gamer addiction,' McGonigal makes an inspiring case for the way games can both enhance our personal happiness and help society.

At a time of trial, each brother struggled to understand his obligation to his country, family, and faith. Centered around the story of the eldest, Norman Thomas (later the six-time Socialist candidate for president), the book explores the difficult decisions the four brothers faced with the advent of World War I. Sons of a Presbyterian minister and grandsons of missionaries, they shared a rigorous moral upbringing, a Princeton education, and a faith in the era's spirit of hope. Two became soldiers. Ralph enlisted right away, heeding President Woodrow Wilson's call to fight for freedom. A captain in the Army Corps of Engineers, he was ultimately wounded in France. Arthur, the youngest, was less certain about the righteousness of the cause but sensitive to his obligation as a citizen-and like so many men eager to have a chance to prove himself. The other two were pacifists. Evan became a conscientious objector, protesting conscription; when the truce was signed on November 11, 1918, he was in solitary confinement.

Conscience does pay due attention to her forebear, but it also traces the parallel stories of his three brothers. Two of them answered President Woodrow Wilson's call to war by becoming soldiers; Norman and his brother Evan both became conscientious objectors. This thoughtful group biography reveals how four members of one remarkable family coped with the moral complexities of responsibilities and beliefs. An extraordinary microhistory of a conscientious period in American history.",

        "description": "An eye-opening account of how the hidden rise of personalization on the Internet is controlling-and limiting-the information we consume.  In December 2009, Google began customizing its search results for each user. Instead of giving you the most broadly popular result, Google now tries to predict what you are most likely to click on. According to MoveOn.org board president Eli Pariser, Google's change in policy is symptomatic of the most significant shift to take place on the Web in recent years-the rise of personalization. In this groundbreaking investigation of the new hidden Web, Pariser uncovers how this growing trend threatens to control how we consume and share information as a society-and reveals what we can do about it. Though the phenomenon has gone largely undetected until now, personalized filters are sweeping the Web, creating individual universes of information for each of us. Facebook-the primary news source for an increasing number of Americans-prioritizes the links it believes will appeal to you so that if you are a liberal, you can expect to see only progressive links. Even an old-media bastion like The Washington Post devotes the top of its home page to a news feed with the links your Facebook friends are sharing. Behind the scenes a burgeoning industry of data companies is tracking your personal information to sell to advertisers, from your political leanings to the color you painted your living room to the hiking boots you just browsed...",

That's a mistake, says Daniel H. Pink inDrive. In this provocative and persuasive new book, he asserts that the secret to high performance and satisfaction-at work, at school, and at home-is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does-and how that affects every aspect of life. He examines the three elements of true motivation- autonomy, mastery, and purpose-and offers smart and surprising techniques for putting these into action in a unique book that will change how we think and transform how we live.",

A passionate narrative voice combines with meticulous research to unpack the confluence of circumstances and personalities that led Germany from the defeat of WWI to the atrocities of WWII. Abundant source documentation (sermons, letters, journal entries, lectures, the Barman Declaration) brings to life the personalities and experiences that shaped Bonhoeffer: his highly intellectual, musical family; theologically liberal professors, pastoral colleagues and students; his extensive study, work, and travel abroad. Tracing Bonhoeffer's developing call to be a Jeremiah-like prophet in his own time and a growing understanding that the church was called 'to speak for those who could not speak,' Metaxas details Bonhoeffer's role in religious resistance to Nazism, and provides a compelling account of the faith journey that eventually involved the Lutheran pastor in unsuccessful attempts to assassinate Hitler.

        "description": "Kathy Freston wasn't born a vegan. The bestselling author and renowned wellness expert actually grew up on chicken-fried steak and cheesy grits, and loved nothing more than BBQ ribs and vanilla milkshakes. Not until her thirties did she embrace the lifestyle of a veganist--someone who eats a plant-based diet not just for their own personal well-being, but for the whole web of benefits it brings to our ecosystem and beyond. Kathy's shift toward this new life was gradual--she leaned into it--but the impact was profound. Now Kathy shows us how to lean into the veganist life. Effortless weight loss, reversal of disease, environmental responsibility, spiritual awakening--these are just a few of the ten profound changes that can be achieved through a gentle switch in food choices.Filled with compelling facts, stories of people who have improved their weight and health conditions as a result of making the switch, and Q&As; with the leading medical researchers, Veganist concludes with a step-by-step practical guide to becoming a veganist&#133;easily and gradually. It is an accessible, optimistic, and illuminating book that will change the way you eat forever. No less delicious, still hearty and satisfying--just better for you and for all.",

        "review": "In this cheery manifesto, healthy-living guru Freston (Quantum Wellness) promises readers who gives up meat, dairy, and eggs that they will effortlessly lose weight, avoid cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's, save money, help the poor, reduce their carbon footprint and animal suffering, and evolve spiritually. Freston, coining the word 'veganist,' puts a soft edge on the vegan lifestyle: 'It's not about hard lines or purity or perfection but about intention and holding ideas loosely and taking steps in the direction of the kind of person you want to be.' She supports her claims with interviews from medical authorities like Dean Ornish and Neal Barnard, numerous stories from people who converted and changed their lives, and a few tales from animal rights activists who went undercover in the factory farm. The book provides 'tips for making the switch,' FAQs answered by Dr. Barnard, and sample menus, but no recipes, so readers used to meat and potatoes may be stymied by how to prepare 'flax seed and whole-grain pizza with classic margherita topping.' Even so, for the novice, this book offers a gentle, guilt-free path to a meatless (or even, as Feston says, 'vegan-ish') life.(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.  All rights reserved.",

        "description": "It's no secret that women have long been overlooked and under-compensated, and while great strides have made in recent decades, the value placed on women versus their male counterparts is still consistently unbalanced. InKnowing Your Value, bestselling author Mika Brzezinski takes an in-depth look at how women today achieve their deserved recognition and financial worth.Prompted by her own experience as co-host of Morning Joe, Mika interviews a number of prominent women across a wide range of industries on their experience moving up in their fields. Mika reveals how these women, including such impresarios as White House star Valerie Jarrett, comedian Susie Essman, writer and director Nora Ephron, Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, and broadcaster Joy Behar, navigated the inevitable roadblocks that are unique to women. Mika also uncovers what men think about the approach women take in the workplace, getting honest answers from Donnie Deutsch, Jack Welch, Donald Trump, and others about why women are paid less, and what pitfalls women face&#151;and play into&#151;as they try to get their worth at work.Knowing Your Valueblends these personal stories and opinions with the latest research and polling on issues such as equal pay, women in the boardroom, and access to start-up capital.Written in Mika's brutally honest, funny, and self-deprecating style, Knowing Your Value is a vital book for professional women of all ages.",

        "review": "Brzezinski knew that her role as cohost of the MSNBC show Morning Joe was integral to the show's success, and yet she was getting paid a fraction of what her male counterparts were. The network was certainly to blame, but so, she realized, was she; this was just the last in a long run of jobs where she'd seen a salary discrepancy, worked long hours to prove herself, got angry at herself for not earning more money and respect, and stormed off and got a new job&mdash;only to repeat the pattern. Wondering if other successful women also consistently undermined and undercut themselves, she interviews power women&mdash;Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, Tina Brown, Nora Ephron, Suze Orman, and Facebook CEO Sheryl Sandberg. Brzezinski illustrates how women undervalue themselves in the workplace&mdash;excessive gratitude 'just to have the opportunity,' not negotiating their contracts, taking on extra work for which they're not being paid, and asking for raises in ways in which they're virtually certain to be turned down. While these insights are familiar, the celebrity angle provides much-needed perspective&mdash;if even the most successful women undervalue themselves out of a desire to be liked, as Joy Behar admits, then clearly the rest of us accepting 77 cents on our male colleagues' dollar are not alone. A thoughtful look at how women can quit getting in their own way. (May)",

        "description": "Photography has been the business and the passion of LIFE since the original weekly magazine's inception in 1936, and it continues to be the business and passion of LIFE Books and LIFE.com in the new millennium. But photography has surely changed during these many decades. The rigs and gear of old have given way-first slowly, then all at once-to sleek miracle machines that process pixels and have made the darkroom obsolete. The casual photog puts eye to lens, sets everything on auto and captures a photograph that is . . . perfectly fine.One of LIFE's master shooters-in fact, the final in the long line of distinguished LIFE staff photographers-was Joe McNally, and he has always believed that with a little preparation and care, with a dash of enthusiasm and daring added to the equation, anyone can make a better photo-anyone can turn a 'keeper' into a treasure. This was true in days of yore, and it's true in the digital age. Your marvelous new camera, fresh from its box, can indeed perform splendid feats. Joe explains in this book how to take best advantage of what it was designed to do, and also when it is wise to outthink your camera or push your camera-to go for the gold, to create that indelible family memory that you will have blown up as large as the technology will allow, and that will hang on the wall forevermore.As the storied LIFE photographer and photo editor John Loengard points out in his eloquent foreword to this volume, there are cameras and there are cameras,...",

Our cameras were trained on Liz since National Velvet, and our splendid archive of photography needs to be seen-by you, her fans, right now, in this moment.Elizabeth first appeared on LIFE's cover when she was barely a teenager, and last graced the cover when she trusted LIFE to tell the story of her late-in-life brain surgery with taste and accuracy. In between there was all the rest&#58; the child-star days, the early marriages, the sensational movies, the incredible drama that was 'Liz and Dick,' the later success on the Broadway stage, the transition to regal presence&#58; benefactor, Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, American icon.It is all in the pages of this special commemorative book.",

So he should have been prepared for this one&#8230;'Julian Treslove, a professionally unspectacular former BBC radio producer, and Sam Finkler, a popular Jewish philosopher, writer and television personality, are old school friends. Despite a prickly relationship and very different lives, they've never quite lost touch with each other&#151;or with their former teacher, Libor Sevcik, a Czech always more concerned with the wider world than with exam results.Now, both Libor and Finkler are recently widowed, and with Treslove, his chequered and unsuccessful record with women rendering him an honorary third widower, they dine at Libor's grand, central London apartment.It's a sweetly painful evening of reminiscence in which all three remove themselves to a time before they had loved and lost; a time before they had fathered children, before the devastation of separations, before they had prized anything greatly enough to fear the loss of it. Better, perhaps, to go through life without knowing happiness at all because that way you have less to mourn? Treslove finds he has tears enough for the unbearable sadness of both his friends' losses.And it's that very evening, at exactly 11:30 pm, as Treslove, walking home, hesitates a moment outside the window of the oldest violin dealer in the country, that he is attacked. And after this, his whole...",

        "description": "In this delightful collection of humorous anecdotes and heartfelt observations, Henry Winkler shares the joy and wisdom he&#8217;s accumulated while honing his skills as a fly fisherman. A accomplished sportsman who meticulously records the measurements of every fish he hooks, Winkler has learned that his yearly trips to the river are not just about catching trout. More importantly, they&#8217;re about adopting the proper perspective on life. Or, as Winkler puts it, when he&#8217;s fly fishing, the river acts like a &#147;washing machine for my brain,&#8221; recharging him and reminding him that anything is possible. Winkler makes a habit of sharing his angling adventures with his wife, Stacey, and their three children, Jed, Zoe, and Max. The Winklers&#8217; annual trip, where they can escape the busyness of everyday life, has brought them together as a family. On the river, Henry has grown to appreciate the support his wife and children give him, learned to listen, and developed the confidence to publish his outdoor photography in his first non-fiction book.An expression of the inherent optimism that stems from the simplicity of the outdoors,I&#8217;ve Never Met an Idiot on the Riveris an invitation to share in the realizations and achievements Winkler",

        "review": "Actor, director, and children's author Winkler offers an amalgam of memoir, self-help, fishing, and photography in this slim, illustrated volume. Born to German immigrant parents in Manhattan, Winkler had undiagnosed dyslexia that wreaked havoc on his early education and self-esteem (his parents calling him 'dumb dog' didn't help either), yet he managed to graduate college, earn a drama master's from Yale, get film work, and land a career-defining role on a popular sitcom. An invite from a friend introduced Winkler to fly-fishing; he was instantly smitten. Fly-fishing became his overwhelming passion, and his angling jaunts to the trout heaven of Montana's rivers became an annual ritual. The majestic scenery surrounding the water led to an interest in nature photography (the book sports numerous pix). VERDICT Winkler's message is positive and upbeat, making the book as much a motivational title as a fishing memoir. The important lesson he learned from his achievements is that with patience, persistence, and practice you can accomplish anything. Although that might seem simplistic, it's a core lesson that, alas, is often forgotten in our current narcissistic age. Well done, Henry. This breezy, charming volume is for fans of celebrity memoirs and self-help.&mdash;Mike Rogers, Library Journal",

Taking turns with the narrative, both are funny, smart and skilled at evoking the thrill of the open (dusty, sandy, gravelly, pot-holed) road. With a trusty team of logisticians, plus local 'fixers' in each country, the duo survive spills, wildlife, nutty drivers, border delays, searing heat and misdirection, while squeezing in some time for sightseeing. A compassionate thread limns the macho derring-do, which includes efforts to raise awareness for UNICEF and other children's charities. Bearing witness to the health and poverty crises in Africa, they put human faces and stories to the statistics, and find hope in a visit with Riders for Health, who bring medical help to hard-to-reach sites via motorcycles: 'the most effective answer to the problems of reaching people in remote areas; I could see it working all over the world.' Though long and exhausting, McGregor reports of the journey that he 'didn't want it to end'; readers-especially fans of their first volume-will likely agree. 20 b&w; illus., 48 pages of color photos.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But another survivor has a different plan a burning need for retribution and seizes the moment to claim reparation in any form he can find.The Turnaroundtakes us on a journey from the rock-and-soul streets of the '70s to the changing neighborhoods of D.C. today, from the diners and auto garages of the city to the inside of Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the first stop for wounded men and women on their way home from war.

But there are others here who are determined to make amends, on the theory that 'you move along in life, you feel the need to make the beds you left undone.' Plain as this is, it's also cogent and powerful, delivered without the preachiness into which Mr. Pelecanos has been known to lapse. He tells a tight, suspenseful story.

        "review": "1947. Eight years after tussling with starlets, mobsters and studio heads in The Prince of Beverly Hills (2004), former Beverly Hills cop Rick Barron is back, now on the other side of the desk. Everything happens fast at Centurion Studios, where Rick Barron is head of production. Hours after wrapping his first film as director, he decides to put off the war movie he's supposed to be making next in favor of Bitter Creek, a tough Western penned by playwright-turned-screenwriter Sidney Brooks that he is first shown at the wrap party. The next day, he buys the screenplay, starts pre-production, sends a location scout to Wyoming to look at cattle ranches and hires newcomer Vance Calder to star. It isn't long, though, before problems crop up. Somebody mails Rick photostats of Communist Party membership cards in the names of Sidney Brooks and Louise Brecht, who just happens, under the name Glenna Gleason, to be Rick's wife and leading lady. The suicide of Alan James, who's testified as an unfriendly witness before the House Un-American Activities Committee, makes James's old friend Brooks apprehensive about his own subpoena. And with good cause, since the dire consequences of his appearance before the HUAC come as rapidly as Rick's career moves. In one of those unrelated plot lines Woods's fans evidently love, the runaway romance between Vance Calder and Susie Stafford, his Bitter Creek costar, hits a snag when Susie, en route from moving her things from her ex-lover Henrietta ('Hank') Harmon's apartment to the spacious house Vance just bought from Brooks, vanishes with every indication of foul play. You'll be relieved to know that by the end of the year, Bitter Creek opens to strong notices andconsiderable Oscar buzz. Precious little mystery or suspense, but the book's momentum and the blacklist plot line will keep the pages turning. Agent: Anne Sibbald/Janklow & Nesbit Associates",

        "review": "Annabel Greene, who narrates, lives with her gorgeous sisters in  a glass house designed by their architect father, in Dessen's  (This Lullaby) familiar suburb of Lakeview. Predictably, the  surface perfection masks trouble. Oldest sister Kirsten, 'the  family powder keg,' has left for New York. When middle sister  Whitney follows to pursue a modeling career, the two clash, and  Whitney returns home with a full-blown eating disorder. Their  mother, Grace, operates in what Annabel wryly calls the 'default  Greene family mode,' pretending everything is just fine.  Annabel, who inherited this trait, nevertheless begins her  junior year as a pariah. Flashbacks reveal that her unwanted  status is the result of something that happened with the  boyfriend of her ex-best friend, a vicious girl who believes  'everyone had a place and it was her job to make sure you knew  yours.' What moves this story beyond problem novel fare is  Dessen's nuanced characters, especially hulking Owen, another  outcast who, in befriending Annabel, reminds her not to judge by  appearances, while steeping her in his eclectic musical tastes.  Annabel sharply observes everyone's blinders, including most of  her own-with one disturbing exception. The heroine paints her  problem as social ostracism, when really the situation is much  more serious. But since Annabel '[doesn't] do confrontations,'  she swallows the truth until her attacker victimizes someone  else. Comparisons to Melinda, the heroine of Laurie Halse  Anderson's Speak, are inevitable. Dessen packs a lot into this  novel, perhaps too much; but Annabel and Owen's finely limned  connection alone gives this novel staying power. Ages 12-up  (Apr.)

He did PR for Led Zeppelin; he managed the career of Nirvana; he ran Atlantic Records, Mercury Records, and Warner Bros. Records; he launched Stevie Nicks's solo career.

As all-out war looms between the Munchkinland guerrillas and the emperor of Oz's Emerald City soldiers, Brrr the lion, now working as an imperial spy, must somehow glean invaluable information from a crone named Yackle before she dies. But during his interrogation of the irritable oracle, Brrr, the proverbial loner and outsider, uncovers insights into his own mysterious past-and finally begins to understand what it feels like to belong. As usual, the author mixes some relatively weighty existential themes-the search for self, faith, redemption-into his whimsical story line.

The victim appears to be a stranger -- but is \r\nhe? The answer to that question, and to the more \r\npressing mystery of his killer s identity, soon \r\nrests in the hands of Armand Gamache of the \r\nS\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec.Arriving in Three Pines, a town of old friends and, sadly, new \r\nsuspects, the commanding yet kind Gamache deploys his crew \r\nof detectives to gather evidence in the apparently clueless case. \r\nEach discovery -- a corpse that won t stay still, a house whose \r\nrestoration can t erase the aura of its haunted past, a log cabin \r\nlocated deep in the woods that holds an astonishing collection of \r\npriceless artifacts -- ties another enigmatic knot in the intricate \r\nweb of secrets and deceptions Gamache must unravel.Tellingly blending the social pleasures of a cozy with the \r\nescalating terror of a psychological thriller, Penny traces \r\nGamache s investigation as it expands to encompass cultural \r\ntreasures that range from pieces of the fabled Amber Room \r\nto the china of Catherine the Great, from a first edition ofJane \r\nEyreto the violin of the great Czech composer Bohuslav Martin\u00f9, \r\nfrom the modern art of the museums of Montreal to Haida totem \r\npoles on the mist-enshrouded Queen Charlotte Islands of British \r\nColumbia.

        "description": "Thomas Jefferson has inspired countless books that explore his brilliant career, his political philosophy, and his extraordinary accomplishments as a gifted leader. Endlessly inquisitive, he was both a tireless writer and one of the most cosmopolitan men of his age. Yet this collection of Jefferson's reflections on his wide-ranging travels reveals a new side of the man.Eloquent and powerful, Thomas Jefferson's letters and travel diaries from his years abroad as the U.S. minister to France spill onto the pages of this volume in wonderful detail, covering the full range of his interests and passions. Editor Anthony Brandt has sifted through the myriad of writings from this rich period of Jefferson's career to present not only the politician and diplomat but Thomas Jefferson the lover, the father, the farmer, the architect, the man about town, the scientist, the visionary. Jefferson emerges at the end a fully dimensional man, with all his virtues, his flaws, and his extraordinary brilliance fleshed out, standing vividly before us. Thomas Jefferson formulated many of America's highest ideals. Here we see the man himself, and glimpse the world through his eyes.",

No matter&#151;there are plenty in an old trunk upstairs, and soon George is trying on all kinds of outfits. But when he wants to look in the mirror, George finds he has to jump on the bed. Downstairs, the partygoers begin to hear noises. Then the lights go out and they hear a crash! Uh-oh. Did someone say the word ghost?Hans Augusto Rey was born in Hamburg, Germany in 1898. As a child, he spent much of his free time in that city's famous Hagenbeck Zoo drawing animals. After serving in the army during World War I, he studied philology and natural science at the University of Hamburg. He then married Margret Rey and they moved to Montmartre for four years. The manuscript for the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and Curious George was published in 1941. Curious George has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian. Additional Curious George books followed, as well as such other favorites as CECILY G. AND THE NINE MONKEYS and FIND THE CONSTELLATIONS.",

D.A. Lamont has a special job for Garano. As part of a new public relations campaign about the dangers of declining neighborhoods, she's sending him to Watertown to 'come up with a drama,' and she thinks she knows just the case that will serve.

The historical record is unclear on whether Champlain was baptized Protestant or Catholic, but he fought in France's religious wars for the man who would become Henri IV, one of France's greatest kings, and like Henri, he was religiously tolerant in an age of murderous sectarianism. Champlain was also a brilliant navigator. He went to sea as a boy and over time acquired the skills that allowed him to make twenty-seven Atlantic crossings without losing a ship.But we remember Champlain mainly as a great explorer. On foot and by ship and canoe, he traveled through what are now six Canadian provinces and five American states. Over more than thirty years he founded, colonized, and administered French settlements in North America. Sailing frequently between France and Canada, he maneuvered through court intrigue in Paris and negotiated among more than a dozen Indian nations in North America to establish New France. Champlain had early support from Henri IV and later Louis XIII, but the Queen Regent Marie de Medici and Cardinal Richelieu opposed his efforts. Despite much resistance and many defeats, Champlain, by his astonishing dedication and stamina,...",

While Macduffie certainly offers more in the line of theatrics, both performances are earnest and raw, allowing the listeners to ebb and flow with the story as if they were tucked away on the Silverwood's 50-foot catamaran. The journey is the destination in this tersely written tale, and with skilled, experienced narrators guiding the way, this trip proves seaworthy.A Random House hardcover (Reviews, Apr. 14).(June)",

Manhattan is one of the five boroughs that make up New York City. The others are Brooklyn, The Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. It&rsquo;s a persnickety detail, but detail is what STREETWISE&reg; is about. For example, the architectural details drawn on the Manhattan New York map are in outline form. A solid drawing would obscure the streets surrounding the location, and therefore hamper the usability of the map. Only in unobstructed locations will you find a solid drawing.You may not notice this or any of the many other details that combine to make a NY city map that has been called  the best selling map on earth*.  The STREETWISE&reg; Manhattan Map is detailed from lower tip to upper tip. It is layered with information about sites and mass transit routes. The New York City Subway system is one of the most important and vital rail networks in the world. It is also the fastest and cheapest way to travel north-south in New York. Our Manhattan street map has the best designed diagram of the Subway system ever produced on a street map. An inset of Manhattan bus routes complements the Subway system. You are now prepared...",

Nothing could possibly go wrong, unless a seriously mind-blowing, dangerously fashionable, rollerblading delivery girl named Ramona Flowers starts cruising through his dreams and sailing by him at parties.

        "review": "Scott Pilgrim is 23 years old, lives in a cold, unnamed Canadian  town, plays bass in a band called Sex Bob-Omb and has a very  cute 17-year-old Chinese-Canadian girlfriend, Knives Chau. His  'precious little life' is amiably unstructured, and he drifts,  happily unemployed, between band practice and time spent with  Knives. His relationship with Knives is chaste-walks, chats and  hugs-although Knives is getting bigger ideas. 'We haven't even  held hands,' Scott explains. 'It's just nice, you know.' But  then he starts having dreams about Ramona Flowers, a mysterious,  equally cute and perfectly legal hipster chick on Rollerblades  who delivers books for Amazon.com. Ramona is anything but  simple, and O'Malley's tale of adorable slackers in love is  transformed into a wildly magically manga-kung fu fantasy  adventure. We meet the first of Ramona's seven evil  ex-boyfriends, Matthew Patel, who challenges Scott and his band  to a supernatural martial arts duel right out of Crouching  Tiger, Hidden Dragon. O'Malley has crafted a delightfully hybrid  comics love story. It's an alt-lit, rock 'n' roll graphic novel  with wonderful manga-influenced drawing and a comically mystical  plot that manages to capture both the genuine intimacies and  serial dishonesties of young love.

Supplementing this treasure trove of images are hundreds of quotations and references from relevant books, movies, shows and songs. The city's fluctuating fortunes are all represented, from the wild nights of the Jazz Age and the hedonistic disco era, to the grim days of the Depression and the devastation of 9/11 and its aftermath, as its broken-hearted but unbowed citizens picked up the pieces.&#160;  Chapter One (1850-1913) focuses on New York's dramatic emergence as America's greatest metropolis. Chapter Two (1914-1945) traces the boom of the 1920s, the Great Depression, and the construction of the city's most famous landmarks&#58; the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building and Rockefeller Center. Chapter Three (1946-1965) sees New York become the world's first truly international city, with the construction of the U.N. headquarters. In Chapter Four, the Big Apple loses its shine (1966-1987) during a period of economic decline, social protest and mean streets. Chapter Five (1988-2009) sees New York rise again from the lean times of the 1970s and early 80s, only to be devastated by the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which forever alter the city's landscape&mdash;and its sense of self. More than just a remarkable tribute to the metropolis and its civic, social, and photographic...",
